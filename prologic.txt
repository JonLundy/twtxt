2020-07-18T12:39:52Z	Hello World! 😊
2020-07-18T13:32:24Z	Hello  @lukem 👋 Welcome!
2020-07-18T13:40:02Z	Testing from Mobile on iOS 👌
2020-07-18T15:00:42Z	Hello @<tomer https://twtxt.net/u/tomer> and @<Paulinux https://twtxt.net/u/Paulinux> 👋 Welcome!
2020-07-19T04:20:17Z	Testing new features
2020-07-19T04:22:53Z	My own account is not full of rubbish that her and bad foods that don’t work !
2020-07-19T04:23:16Z	I need to add a delete account feature so that I can reset and start over fresh foods that are actually correct.
2020-07-19T06:02:51Z	@<Dad https://twtxt.net/u/Rob> I hope  that's you there :D 👋 Can't be acoincidencee that I just spoke to you on the phone  snd shared twtxt.net  with you 😊
2020-07-19T23:09:53Z	🤗 I’m very happy with twtxt.net 😍
2020-07-20T06:59:52Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Is it okay to have two personas :) I have https://twtxt.net/u/prologic and https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt 🤔
2020-07-20T12:50:01Z	As of today, twtxt.net supports Cat pictures! 🙀 ![](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/20/18/03/cat-2083492_1280.jpg)
2020-07-20T12:51:12Z	Actually what https://twtxt.net/ really supports is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
2020-07-20T14:04:25Z	Updated the [IndieWeb twtxt](https://indieweb.org/twtxt) page 🤗
2020-07-20T21:13:41Z	@<kevinmarks https://twtxt.net/u/kevinmarks> Hello! 👋 Welcome 😊
2020-07-20T21:16:27Z	@<dc https://twtxt.net/u/dc> Hi! 👋 Welcome! to https://twtxt.net 🤗 -- a) Yes this will remain this simple. b) Yes you can communicate with someone on another twtxt
2020-07-20T21:17:30Z	@<dc https://twtxt.net/u/dc> Basically you follow their URL on your own twtxt instance and vice versa. The _problem_ is one of discoverability which I plan to...
2020-07-20T21:18:20Z	@<dc https://twtxt.net/u/dc> (re discoverability) ... build out a builtin registry for easy @user mention searching as well as recording which clients hit your twtxt
2020-07-20T21:20:36Z	Don't forget, anyone new here or that discovers https://twtxt.net that you can discuss issues on https://github.com/prologic/twtxt
2020-07-20T21:34:13Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re mentions): Yes if other users are nice and disclose their identity in their client(s) you can see who/what fetches...
2020-07-20T21:35:06Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re mentions) ... your feeds. I _might_ add a builtin feature for this to https://twtxt.net/ no idea how I should present it?
2020-07-20T21:36:10Z	Hmmm 🤔 I think the `MaxTweetLength` should be configurable here and I should increase it from `144` to say `288`?
2020-07-20T21:48:47Z	Re discoverability on https://twtxt.net Please read/comment/discuss [here](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/14) I plan to add this.
2020-07-20T21:57:44Z	@<demetriusz https://twtxt.net/u/demetriusz> Hi! 👋 Welcome to https://twtxt.net 😊 Yes! [Go](https://golang.org) rocks 😍
2020-07-20T23:52:08Z	**ANN:** [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) now has a configurable `MaxTweetlength` and is by default now `288`. Thank you 😀
2020-07-21T00:20:42Z	[Discovering new twtxt users User-Agent data](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/14) is something I want to discuss with the wider community. The technical impl details are easy, but I'm not sure how to present the data on [twtxt](https://twtxt.net). Thoughts?
2020-07-21T00:22:33Z	(re Discovering new twtxt users): Some ideas: 1) A new dedicated view/page 2) A "special" internal/builtin feed you can follow 3) Inject discovered users directly into the [/discover](https://twtxt.net/discover) view 4) Something else?
2020-07-21T02:33:47Z	@<schollz https://twtxt.net/u/schollz> You're welcome! 🙇‍♂️ And hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)
2020-07-21T04:34:25Z	**ANN:** No. Everything is not gone. I just fixed a very important cache bug and deleted the cache. _Everything__ will reappear in a few mins at the next feed/cache update (_which runs every 5mins_).
2020-07-21T08:04:35Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (re crowded) Haha 🤣 Yeah I've _thought_ about limited the no. of users that a [twtxt](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt) instance (_like this one_) is allowed to have (_configurable by the operator_). What od you think? 🤔
2020-07-21T08:05:17Z	@<lesley https://twtxt.net/u/lesley> Hello! 👋
2020-07-21T08:06:42Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re post length): Ahh yes that makes sense in your case. But I _think_ it makes sense to limit the length of posts anyway; you end up with all kinds of problems if you leave it open ended.
2020-07-21T08:09:32Z	Going to add a [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) view here soon (_tonight hopefully; AEST tz_) where I will immediate make all the feeds available at https://feeds.twtxt.net available to be followed by new users.
2020-07-21T14:05:46Z	**ANN:** [twtxt v0.0.5](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/releases/tag/0.0.5) is out and now running on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🎉
2020-07-21T15:41:35Z	@<lesley https://twtxt.net/u/lesley> I made available a bunch more external feeds you can follow. You can now also see them integrated here at [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds). If you want to import more have a look at https://blog.feedspot.com/world_news_rss_feeds/ and add any you want to https://feeds.twtxt.net/

2020-07-21T21:40:29Z	@<srohde https://twtxt.net/u/srohde> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)
2020-07-21T23:15:50Z	@<flavienbwk https://twtxt.net/u/flavienbwk> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😀 Glad you like it so far :) I'm working on this everyday! I'm also trying to encourage the wider community to grow out instances of `twtxt` and posted about it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23911589)
2020-07-22T00:04:27Z	Some questions you may have on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net); Q: Will this always be free? Yes. Q: Will there ever be advertising or tracking? No! Q: What personal information is collected about me? Almost none, besides you email for password resets (_which is optional_).
2020-07-22T00:08:02Z	For more information on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)'s privacy see the [/privacy](https://twtxt.net/privacy) policy. Promise is very terse and void of legal jargon!
2020-07-22T00:29:44Z	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> `lighthttpd` is also quite good actually :) Used to use it for the longest time!
2020-07-22T01:01:37Z	[@felixplesoianu](https://twitter.com/felixplesoianu) just [posted](https://twitter.com/felixplesoianu/status/1285273103237550084?s=20) recently about `twtxt` in general, and I _hope_ I had something to with it! 🙇‍♂️
2020-07-22T01:03:33Z	[@tomoXtechno](https://twitter.com/tomoXtechno) [posted](https://twitter.com/tomoXtechno/status/1284858047412617216?s=20) about `twtxt` too. I wouldn't call [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) "primitive" though @tomoXtechno :) Come check it out!
2020-07-22T01:05:53Z	@<solquemal https://twtxt.net/u/solquemal> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-22T02:34:32Z	@<dai https://twtxt.net/u/dai> Hi! 👋 You're welcome! Welcome to this instance of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) too! 🤗 Are you planning on running your own instance too?
2020-07-22T04:09:08Z	🎉 **New:** Improved the [About](https://twtxt.net/about) page and added a [Help](https://twtxt.net/help) page to start documenting how to use `twtxt` and https://twtxt.net/ for new users that are unfamiliar. Please provide feedback!
2020-07-23T00:30:41Z	Bit quiet in twtxt today 🤔
2020-07-23T00:34:34Z	Today in my [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) feed; Twitter nukes 70,000 accounts related to QAnon 🙀 Microsoft shuts down a service I never heard of! 😂 And [Coronavirus](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) cases tops ~15M worldwide 😢 Oh my what a day! Happy twt'ing 🤗
2020-07-23T02:52:53Z	🎉 **NEW:** New feature to improve discoverability. Basically the server now tracks new potential followers by parsing the `twtxt` User-Agent (_if valid_) and posts this on a special feed [twtxt](https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt) (_which you can follow_)...
2020-07-23T02:53:51Z	Re (new Followers feature): In addition your "Followers" list on your [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) are also updated as new potential followers are detected. 🤗 Happy twt'ing!
2020-07-23T03:40:58Z	**ANN:** [twtxt v0.0.6](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/releases/tag/0.0.6) is out and now running on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🎉
2020-07-23T05:34:19Z	And it works! Yay (Followers feature): > FOLLOW: @<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> from @Felix using txtnish/0.2
2020-07-23T06:52:10Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> (re Replace Twitter): Now that would be quite funny now wouldn't it? 🤣 I don't expect it to at all, but you never know with these organic, decentralised things (_oh wait that's what the Internet and Web was suppose to be in the first place! 😂_)
2020-07-23T07:47:28Z	@Felix (re twtxt usage); I even notice your response to my notice :) https://twitter.com/felixplesoianu/status/1285801786683555840?s=20 Thanks for the positive feedback and affirmation!
2020-07-23T07:48:42Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt usage); I even notice your response to my notice :) https://twitter.com/felixplesoianu/status/1285801786683555840?s=20 Thanks for the positive feedback and affirmation!
2020-07-23T08:15:52Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> You're welcome ! 😎 LMK if you have any great ideas for improvements to existing features or new features 😉
2020-07-23T08:16:42Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/u/becrobinson86> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-23T12:11:45Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> Happy Friday to you too! (_although it's still Thursday evening for me 🤣_) 🙌
2020-07-23T12:12:51Z	@<pfefferle https://twtxt.net/u/pfefferle> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-23T12:14:52Z	@<notizblog https://notiz.blog/feed/twtxt> Hello there! Glad to have you in our growing `twtxt` community 🤗
2020-07-23T12:20:57Z	@<iolfree https://tilde.club/~iolfree/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Thanks for following me on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-23T14:24:30Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> Oh! 🤣 I see! What TZ are you in?
2020-07-23T14:27:58Z	🎉 **NEW:** With the latest software update to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) you will now see in [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) your "Followers". Amazingly I have 11 followers already, some of which are external to here! 🙀
2020-07-23T23:56:14Z	@<artik3t https://twtxt.net/u/artik3t> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-24T02:03:01Z	Re: [Twitter Is Considering Subscriptions Amid An Advertising Slump]( http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/fRaN9xUp2l4/twitter-is-considering-subscriptions-amid-an-advertising-slump) Well you don't say! 😂
2020-07-24T02:04:38Z	Re (Twitter considering subscription): Who would have _thought_ that "Social Media" backed by advertising business models where users are in fact their product would ultimately start to fail?! 😱 Get on the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) band-wagonn! 🤗
2020-07-24T04:43:07Z	😷 So apparently doctors in Australia are sending anyone that have typical and obvious common cold or flu like symptoms   To get COVID-19 tested! 😳 Naturally this is overwhelming local testing laboratories from actually testing things that are far more critical! 🤷‍♂️
2020-07-24T05:25:43Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re Social Media Subscriptions) Yeah I agree! I was mostly commenting on the astonishment of advertising models 😉 I plan to do something similar to Micro.blog with [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) like paid hosted instances. 😁
2020-07-24T07:03:53Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> (re Brisbane) Yeah we're going okay in this little part of the world Australia/Brisbane! Things are going back to normal now and settling back down. What part of the world are you from?
2020-07-24T07:05:31Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> What?! You were expecting another software update already? 😱 Its coming! Hopefully with a new UI/UX update! But bare in mind there are silent updates made every few hours -- e.g: the spacing between posts on Desktop has been fixed already! 🎉
2020-07-24T07:09:28Z	@<Dad https://twtxt.net/u/Rob> Hey! 👋 Glad to have you onboard! I would encourage you to bring across some of your acquittances you talk to on other forums here and start having `short-form` conversations 😀
2020-07-24T07:39:52Z	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> (re [Slingcode](https://slingcode.net/)) I don't get it 🤔 Can you explain it like I'm 5? 😀
2020-07-24T10:57:12Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/u/hellson> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 -- Its `short-form` posts, decentralised, very simple, no tracking, no advertising; bit like Twitter™ but not 😀

2020-07-24T12:48:25Z	@<migandhi https://twtxt.net/u/migandhi> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 -- Can I ask; Where did you see it trending? 😊
2020-07-24T12:55:05Z	😱 Is [Twitter](https://twitter.com) now effectively a "closed system" ![](https://i.imgur.com/DcmQnlm.png)
2020-07-24T12:57:07Z	re (Twitter landing page); No you just have to go to https://twitter.com/explore if you don't have an account! 🤣 (_non-obvious_)
2020-07-24T13:00:37Z	@<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> [posted](https://twitter.com/johanbove/status/1286550592823975936?s=20) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com)™ -- You're welcome Johan! Hope to see you in the `twtxt` community 😊
2020-07-24T13:02:30Z	@<migandhi https://twtxt.net/u/migandhi> (re Trending) Oh my! 😱 I'm a trending Developer on [Github](https://github.com) 😯
2020-07-24T13:09:04Z	😍 😱 🙀 It's very humbling to see that somehow I (_the developer of_) and [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) have somehow hit the #1 spot on [Github](https://github.com) Trending Developers. ![](https://i.imgur.com/RL3bQAB.png)
2020-07-24T13:13:09Z	@kasra471 [posted](https://twitter.com/kasra471/status/1286270495697129473?s=20) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com)™ -- Thanks! I'll have a read 😊
2020-07-24T13:46:06Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re UA strings) Hah! Yeah I built a feature into [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) such that the backend automatically picks these up and posts to a special feed @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> and updates your account's "Followers". Its quite neat  :) Also hi @<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> 👋
2020-07-24T13:47:46Z	🎉 **NEW:** Out of frustration for myself, I added a tiny/teeny UI/UX change to the timeline view. You will now see a `[Reply]` link where it will conveniently fill out the text box at the top for you with `@<nick> ` and automatically focus you there ready to type. Enjoy! 🤗
2020-07-24T13:50:52Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (re Reply feature) You're very welcome! Hopefully everyone will find it useful! cc @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> @<lesley https://twtxt.net/u/lesley>
2020-07-24T13:51:59Z	Next up is `@mentions` I think. And tag extraction from posts. Let's make discoverability even better! 😂
2020-07-24T14:01:14Z	@longkey1 [posted](https://twitter.com/longkey1/status/1286598042020220928?s=20) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com)™ Translation: "twtxt I like it very much, but it doesn't seem to be very popular. Too bad." -- Like everything new and shiny, its not always popular at first! Give it a go!
2020-07-24T14:40:50Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Yes [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) most certainly does. However there is a catch; since a "fetch" is not associated with any one user, it's impossible to say "who" follows your feed on an `twtxt` instance. Something to work out perhaps?
2020-07-24T14:53:40Z	@<melyanna https://tilde.club/~melyanna/twtxt.txt> (re house cat) I have one! It prowls around and wrecks things! 🙀 Why do you want to be a house cat? 🤣
2020-07-24T15:14:19Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> Glad you like the `[Reply]` feature :)
2020-07-24T22:05:10Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/u/rob> external feeds are created over at https://feeds.twtxt.net which are periodically pulled in to populate the [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) view 😃
2020-07-24T22:10:44Z	@<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> looks like you have. New follower here on [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) 😊You can follow the special feed @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> or check your new “Followers” in [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) 😎
2020-07-24T22:15:51Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re include URL of followers) Yes this is def a possibility.  You could also follow the social feed @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> of any [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and watch for mentions of yourself 😀
2020-07-24T22:21:00Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re checking your twtxt client) oh! This is similar to @<tiktok https://enotty.dk/tiktok.txt> ?
2020-07-24T22:33:05Z	🙃 Exciting news! Looks like [we're getting serious about building a iOS App](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/24) Thanks @<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> 😎
2020-07-24T22:36:27Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> Hahaha 🤣 Are you implying that [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is a VC funded company with millions of 💵 and we just happen to have hired some excellent marketing folks?! Hah! 😂  #twtxt #humour
2020-07-24T22:39:15Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re std config for twtxt clients) Yes! This is very similar to [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) (_which I contributed to a few bit recently, it's a nice CLI client_). I'm _thinking_ of doing this for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) whereby you can export your account...
2020-07-24T22:40:23Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> ((re std config for twtxt clients) Where you can export your "account" as a `config.yaml` and import it into other clients. You know in case you don't like [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) specifically or you do and you just want to use multiple clients : )
2020-07-24T22:56:17Z	🎉 **ANN:** New version of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) [v0.0.7](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/releases/tag/0.0.7) is out! Highlights include a `[Reply]` feature for posts, a special @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> feed for internal events, improved UI/UX and loads of bug fixes! Enjoy and happy twt'ing 🤗
2020-07-24T23:13:17Z	Plan for the weekend: Build out more neat features for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😊 Can't decide between a) `@mention` and `#hashtag` parsing and discovery or b) A JSON/HTTP API for a potential Mobile iOS App that _may_ be coming? Any ideas? 🤗
2020-07-24T23:14:30Z	Re (weekend plans) Or c) Figure out how Web Push works and build Web Push notifications into the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) web client instance. But this also depends on parsing mentions to be useful 🤔
2020-07-24T23:42:37Z	@<flavienbwk https://twtxt.net/u/flavienbwk> (re great idea) Great idea to which thing? 🤣 a, b or c? 😂
2020-07-25T00:06:26Z	❓**Help**: Added a new section ton the [/help](https://twtxt.net/help) on "Formatting your posts" which btw for those familiar actually supports  [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (_although don't use the full feature-set as `twtxt` is still a line-oriented system!_)
2020-07-25T04:43:44Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> `Antonio Rodrigues invited you to join the team: "Mobile twtxt"` 👈 Got your invite thanks! This Mobile App (iOS) for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is _really_ gonna happen! Yay 🎉
2020-07-25T05:03:38Z	Yes
2020-07-25T05:14:27Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> Looks like it 😎cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/u/antonio> 😍
2020-07-25T07:25:37Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re include URL of followers) I know followers and mentions are not the same 😊 Not sure what your point was? 🤔
2020-07-25T07:27:11Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re std config for twtxt clients) Yes! I was thinking the same too. Why don't you help us both here and the general `twtxt` developer which probably only consists of @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt> and myself (@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic>) right now by filing an issue to document this on the project Issues?
2020-07-25T07:28:56Z	@<dmje https://twtxt.net/u/dmje> (re things on your mind) Haha 🤣 Why don't you share them with us? 😊 Alternatively the backend could rotate the `Placeholder` text on the `text` input? 🤔
2020-07-25T07:29:31Z	@<dmje https://twtxt.net/u/dmje> Also Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-25T08:50:17Z	@<melyanna https://tilde.club/~melyanna/twtxt.txt> Happy Saturday to you too! 😎
2020-07-25T09:23:10Z	🎉 **NEW:** New _sub_Feed(s) feature whereby you can create new feeds (_call them personas if you want_) associated with your account and then you can "Post as" those feeds.
2020-07-25T09:31:50Z	Re (new sub-Feeds) Simply navigate to [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) where you can create your own feeds that you control and can "post" as. Think of this as interest topics, subtwts or special interest groups :) Please give me feedback if you try this out! It's brand spank'n **NEW**!
2020-07-25T10:13:07Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re fetching from [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) users...) Yes I understand what you're saying. Do you mind filing an issue for this on the [Issues](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues) page? This can be solved easily, it just really depends on the implementation details.
2020-07-25T10:13:53Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re filing issues) https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues Thanks!
2020-07-25T10:54:50Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Thank you! I'll respond there and if trivial enough will probably implement it shortly :) Out of curiosity do you have many fetches from [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) at the moment? The backend (_by default_) fetches/polls feeds very ~5m.
2020-07-25T12:18:59Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re fetches from twtxt.net) Fair enough. I'll have a read of your [Issue](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/35) hopefully we can come up with something! The original [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) is a bit sparse, but that's something I hope to influence...
2020-07-25T13:08:34Z	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Welcome back! 😎 Have you seen https://twtxt.net/ yet? 😊
2020-07-25T13:32:47Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re polling interval) Yeah you're probably right. I developed this thing quickly (_as you know_) and am iterating quickly. What I'd like to do is have a sort-of back-off internal algorithm  where feeds are only polled based on the frequency of their updates. Make sense?
2020-07-25T14:11:47Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re polling) The problem is I borrowed a fair bit of the "feed cache and fetching" code from @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt> 's [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) (_which I also spent a bit helping improve_). I _think_ the feed cache would have to be refactored somewhat for this (_plus other benefits_)
2020-07-25T14:20:34Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re `HEAD` req) Yeah that would also save a few "full fetches" provided all sources of feeds correctly implemented `HEAD` 🙃 Do you want to have a go at this? You'll want to patch [these lines](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/blob/master/cache.go#L105-L131)
2020-07-25T15:07:57Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re contributing) Yes 😂 Because you're a nice person and willing to discuss technical things! 🤣
2020-07-25T22:03:54Z	@<tho https://twtxt.net/u/tho> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😎
2020-07-25T22:04:32Z	@<darkterminal https://twtxt.net/u/darkterminal> Hey hey! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😎
2020-07-25T22:24:44Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re tw.txt) Is that even a valid TLD? I can't find it in my Domain Registrar 🤣
2020-07-25T22:27:16Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re CLI) I am one such command-line asshole 🤣 I'm an old school UNIX engineer, and ai 😍 the command-line and all things UNIX principles 😊 -- That being said however, one has to be realistic or you limit potential use by others...
2020-07-25T22:29:00Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt.net CLI) So that being said... Yes there are plans in the works for a CLI. It will likely be two things. A traditional [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) command-line client with a similar feature-set to @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt> 's [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) ...
2020-07-25T22:30:29Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt.net CLI) ... Plus a command-line client that uses a (_yet to be written_) API to talk directly to a [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) instance. Think of all this as "I want to just use a file, and host it myself", or "Oh I love twtxt.net but sometimes I want to use the CLI".
2020-07-25T22:41:04Z	@<pbatch https://pbat.ch/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Just saw you add your feed to @<we_are_twtxt https://enotty.dk/we-are-twtxt.txt> 😎 Welcome to the (_now_) growing twtxt community 🤗
2020-07-25T22:46:31Z	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (ree new RSS feeds) Feel free to add them to [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) too 😊 It's a free service that consumes RSS/Atom and produces twtxt feeds 😎
2020-07-26T00:15:46Z	On [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)'s sub-Feed(s).  This new feature was born out of two use-cases. For operators to post as @<news https://twtxt.net/u/news> @support and @help; but also an idea that came from @<Dad https://twtxt.net/u/Rob> to help new and existing users create special interest feeds or topics...
2020-07-26T00:17:00Z	On sub-Feed(s): To create a new Feed, navigate to [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds), give your feed a name and hit Submit. Now you can post as that feed in the "Post as" dropdown. This lets you create feeds of special interest or topics. Happy twt'ing! 🤗
2020-07-26T00:27:03Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (re Ansible / Docker) [Docker[(https://www.doker.com) is pretty awesome really 😊 I mostly use it as a packaging tool however, and distribution to production. It's quite easy to learn and get the hang of.
2020-07-26T01:27:31Z	@cook Hello there ! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 — Your first post is just “lol”⁉️🤣 You can do better! 😆

2020-07-26T01:55:41Z	@<darkterminal https://twtxt.net/u/darkterminal> yes of course [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) works! 😁 If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know!
2020-07-26T01:57:24Z	@<darkterminal https://twtxt.net/u/darkterminal> (re notifications) This is coming in an upcoming release ! For now follow the @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/u/twtxt> feed 😎
2020-07-26T02:22:17Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (re reducing manual ops) Yup this is why I have several production [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) clusters, supporting services and tooling...
2020-07-26T05:46:42Z	I blogged about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) to talk more in depth about why I created this and how and the vision I have for this platform. Check it out at: https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/26/twtxtnet-a-decentralized.html 😎
2020-07-26T05:47:54Z	You can also follow my own [prologic_blog](https://feeds.twtxt.net/prologic_blog/twtxt.txt) here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) a [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) hosted blog (_which btw I love Micro.blog! good for longer pieces_).
2020-07-26T06:55:48Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/u/kt84> Yes! If you follow the **NEW** @<stats https://twtxt.net/u/stats> feed you'll see that as of today we have 44 users and >215 posts. Amazing! 😎 Of course it will be even more amazing if new instances of [twtxt.net](https://twxt.net) just start magically appearing 🎉 (cc @<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> 😀)
2020-07-26T07:16:40Z	@<fegffb https://feg-ffb.de/twtxt.txt> Any change you can create a "Weekly_Saying" feed at https://twtxt.net/feeds ? 😎
2020-07-26T08:04:19Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> I'd love it if you can approve ✔️ the new [Add user profile pages and **BREAKS** existing local user feed URIs ](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/pull/27) PR  😎 As [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) grows I'd love it if it wasn't just up to me making all the decisions 😉
2020-07-26T08:48:00Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> testing what ? 😆
2020-07-26T09:06:46Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/u/rob> (re bore pump) What replenishes the bore water? Must come from somewhere 😁
2020-07-26T09:09:13Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/u/off_grid_living> can you share the length of time that you were expecting these battery banks to last for and what you actually got out of them in reality?
2020-07-26T09:24:38Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (first time for everything) haha really?! What do you do all your development collaboration on if not Github?
2020-07-26T09:25:21Z	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> Good Morning ! 🤗
2020-07-26T09:57:25Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/u/lukem> (re Bitbucket) Ahh no worries. Had my fair share of using Bitbucket -- In fact used Mercurial/Bitbucket before  Git/Github 😊 Good times!
2020-07-26T10:02:13Z	📣 **FYI:** For all those that use [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_this instance_); I urge you to follow the special feeds @<news https://twtxt.net/u/news> and @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support> so you get the latest news and support updates about the platform. Thanks! 🤗
2020-07-26T10:14:37Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re script to post to Mastodon) Ahh. Sadly I've evaluated both Mastodon and Diaspora and frankly found them too complicated to get up and running (_as I'm a big proponent of self-hosting_). Is cross-posting important to you btw?
2020-07-26T10:44:35Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re running a Mastodon) instance. Fair enough.
2020-07-26T11:59:05Z	📣  Testing 1 2 3
2020-07-26T12:01:13Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re dumb scripts) Ahh very UNIX(y) 😛 Don't worry there'll be an API here soon that you can `curl` or use `twt` (_the upcoming CLI_).
2020-07-26T12:40:56Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt.net API) What do you mean by replace?
2020-07-26T21:59:38Z	@<xxx https://twtxt.net/user/xxx> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-26T22:01:17Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re News feed) Thanks! That looks like a bug right there 🤣
2020-07-26T22:04:17Z	@<klagefall https://twtxt.net/user/klagefall> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 I don't speak German but if translated correctly, you're only here to visit? That's okay 😎 Maybe twtxt is not for you?
2020-07-26T23:26:18Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re News feed) Sorry you can't have that 🤣 Squished that bug and fixed the bad data! Thanks for exploiting it 😛
2020-07-26T23:40:49Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API spaces) oh cool! I’ll spend some time on this after my work day! 👍
2020-07-26T23:47:57Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> (re Tractor) When we build support for uploading photos 📷 to [twtxt](https://twtxt.net) you can share a little pic of your cute 🚜

2020-07-27T00:18:03Z	👋 @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> and @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> FYI; your "ownership" of @off_grid_livving @local_wonders and @<recipes https://twtxt.net/user/recipes/twtxt.txt> went missing in the database. I just fixed that and restored your ownership of them.  Sorry about that! 🙇‍♂️
2020-07-27T00:38:15Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt, twitter and instagram) What do you mean  by this exactly? I don't actually use Instagram at all! 🤣
2020-07-27T00:43:32Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re News bug) Yeah you were! That PR was a bit untested on my part  and rushed 😢 I've had to spend considerable time fixing bad data as a result of the change 🤬 Hopefully I've fixed most issues by now!  🎉
2020-07-27T00:49:46Z	Hmmm 🤔 speaking of bad data on [twtxt.net](https://twtt.net)... There _might_ be a bit of a bug 🐞 where if users follow a custom feed  on [/follow](https://twtxt.net/follow) and give it a `Nickname` that collides with a local user account, special users or local feeds it gets weird...
2020-07-27T03:06:52Z	Great news! 🎉 I _think_ I might have fixed all the bugs I found and data errors in the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) database. Again let me know if you encounter any other weird/strange things or inconsistencies! Thanks 😎
2020-07-27T03:09:29Z	I've observed two things that aren't bugs per se but I should improve this. a) `@mention`(s) of local users should now link to the local user profile. b) `@mention` of local users that don't appear in your "Followers" list already by Nickname should automatically get expanded out.
2020-07-27T03:18:17Z	😳 Saw this today from an hiring agency "We create 360-degree developer profiles based on the public and private data they hold on various coding sites, including GitHub, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, and more." -- And this is why [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) will succeed! Privacy! 🤔
2020-07-27T03:19:29Z	Re (360-degree developer profiles) -- Note the part about "and private data they hold on various coding sites". I mean sure I have nothing to hide, but it makes me rethink using [Github](https://github.com) myself honestly. What have we become?! 😱
2020-07-27T03:25:26Z	💡Another idea to improve the UX even further on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_now that we have the notion of very basic/minimal user profiles_) is to also have profiles for (sub)Feeds (_local feeds_) as well as external feeds/users with nice preview. Good idea? Please reply :) 😎
2020-07-27T04:04:34Z	Exciting news! 🎉 @<gbmor https://gbmor.dev/twtxt.txt> and I will collaborate on implementing `@mention` and `#tag` parsing for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and surfacing this information to users via special timeline views based on search criteria. 😎 Looking forward to it! 🤗
2020-07-27T04:49:25Z	With the number of possible [external](https://feeds.twtxt.net) and [external users](https://github.com/mdom/we-are-twtxt) growing at an alarming rate! 😱 I should _probably_ group the sources of external users and feeds in the [/feeds](https://twtx.net/feeds) view by source. 🤔

2020-07-27T09:40:38Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> @<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re permalinks) I must have missed this. I am _thinking_ about this for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) but I was thinking of a different solution. The instance's global feed cache hashing each entry and referencing this. If subsequent fetches we still preserve the old ones...
2020-07-27T09:41:51Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> @<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re permalinks) If a feed entry changes it gets a new hash of course, but we still preserve the hash and content of the older one. This way on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) we can _link_ to and ref individual Twt(s) (_ofc only works here_).
2020-07-27T10:34:44Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem> (re plans for the day) Well I'm happy for you 😊 Sounds like a nice day! 😎 Where do you work btw? Also if you can strike up such conversations, spread the word about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)! And thank you for being a part of our every growing community! 🤗

2020-07-27T12:18:40Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re promoting) Yes I also find it hard to strike those conversations! I'm not very good at self-promoting! What engineer is ⁉️ 🤣 May I ask (_kind of curious_); what do you think it is about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) so far that makes you check back more than Twitter™ ?

2020-07-27T14:57:14Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (why twtxt > twitter) aye aye to both! I completely agree. Believe me I've been there, had a Twitter™ account numerous times, only to delete it again! 🤣 I've always wanted something like [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) so I built it! 😎
2020-07-27T15:01:19Z	@luekm Not sure if you're aware about a recent (_only yesterday_) feature I'm dubbing (sub)Feeds. One such feed I recommend you follow is @<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> where I will be posting news about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) from here on 😊

2020-07-27T20:50:59Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re preserving battery chemistry) Would this theory have something to do with the ambient temperature and environment the battery is in while pushing energy into it from Solar end increasing internal heat? 🤔
2020-07-27T20:55:06Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re tw.txt) Cool! I like it so far 😊 The more the merrier! Keep in mind the features you've brought up on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)'s [Issues Page](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt) -- Let's build a good solid ecosystem 😎
2020-07-27T21:00:37Z	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> (re Big Sur); What you do mean?! Who's "Big Sur", Who broke [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org)?
2020-07-27T21:02:28Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re feeds) Yes those ([/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds)) are externally sourced feeds. There is a convenient RSS/Atom -> twtxt aggregator I wrote that integrates with [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) over at [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-27T21:03:57Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Did you check out the PR for the new Identicons feature and thus User Avatars (_custom ones will come later..._)? If not that's okay, I'll merge and deploy this shortly...
2020-07-27T21:08:15Z	@<klagefall https://twtxt.net/user/klagefall/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 Glad to have you join our growing community! 🙇‍♂️
2020-07-27T21:10:03Z	@<klagefall https://twtxt.net/user/klagefall/twtxt.txt> (re blog move) I'm not sure [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) got this right... "How many blog moves will that be? I lost the overview."; But I know what you mean!  Took me a while to find and settle with [Micro.blog](https://micro.blob) (_thanks @manton_)...
2020-07-27T21:11:21Z	@<klagefall https://twtxt.net/user/klagefall/twtxt.txt> (re blog move) But I use Micro.blob for longer-pieces over at my [Blob](https://prologic.blog). I've never found a µBlogging / short-form platform I really liked until I built [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and came across the [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec. 😊
2020-07-27T21:12:36Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re new Identicon/Avatars) No worries. I will merge it now along with another PR hopefully that lets us link to specific posts! Exciting 😊 🎉
2020-07-27T21:29:03Z	🎉 **NEW:** Exciting new features just launched! Thanks to[D. Bohdan](https://github.com/dbohdan) we now have linkable post. Each post can now be referenced and linked to! Woot! 😊 Also exciting are the new User Avatar(s)!!! 😎 By default it generates an avatar based on your Username.
2020-07-27T21:36:24Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re subFeeds) I hope you're talking about subFeeds? If so once you create one it belongs to you and you can use the "Post as me" dropdown to post as that feed. This way you get to create feeds of interesting topics such as @<recipes https://twtxt.net/user/recipes/twtxt.txt> @<home_datacenter https://twtxt.net/user/home_datacenter/twtxt.txt> or @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt>
2020-07-27T21:38:11Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re /feeds) Oh I didn't read up, sorry! Yeah so those are "External Feeds" that are sourced in by the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) backend. THere are currently two sources: [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) and `we-are-twtxt` (_a sort of user registry_).
2020-07-27T21:38:39Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re /feeds) I will add some more sections to the [/help](http://twtxt.net/help)...
2020-07-27T21:41:40Z	@<klagefall https://twtxt.net/user/klagefall/twtxt.txt> (re text based) That's the idea! We won't be messing around with or extending the [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) format/spec anytime soon, but mostly focusing on the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) protocols, features and instance<->instance federation features.
2020-07-27T22:12:46Z	@<Dad https://twtxt.net/user/Rob/twtxt.txt> ⭐️ New auto generated Usar Avatars just like we discussed ! 😎
2020-07-27T23:13:04Z	✨ [60 Github Stars](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt)!!! We must be doing something _right_ here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🎉
2020-07-27T23:19:47Z	🤔 Thinking about using [avatar-uploader](https://github.com/danharper/avatar-uploader) to support user custom avatars...
2020-07-28T00:29:37Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re subFeeds) I'm glad you like it 🤗 I'm currently refactoring it a bit actually and will need to do another data migration on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) when I'm done.
2020-07-28T00:30:31Z	🎉 @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> posted! `🧮 USERS:60 FEEDS:10 POSTS:393` WOW! 😱

2020-07-28T06:27:19Z	There's still a few quicks with [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) I'm not quite happy about. The notion of a `URL` and `TwtURL` for users and feeds is making the code complicated. There are also still inconsistencies in the behaviour.
2020-07-28T08:32:30Z	@<Dad https://twtxt.net/user/Rob/twtxt.txt> sorry about the update today, all feeds got wiped out by accident! 😢
2020-07-28T11:53:13Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Java programs on Windows) Uggh 🤮 I sympathise, but on any OS. For some reason I can never truly understand I despise Java™ with a passion! What a horrible language and technology. It _might_ have been a good solution in the day, but its lost all value IHMO.
2020-07-28T20:55:33Z	Hmmm 🤔 I noticed _some_ users in the wider #twtxt community use !thing (_or commonly referred to as bangs_) in their twts. Anyone have any ideas what this is, why its done and how is useful or different to #hashtags? cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt>
2020-07-28T20:58:01Z	Hmmm interesting UI/UX bug 🐞 for me to fix on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) this morning. If you follow a TwtURL (_technical term for a feed or user, as the name is just a "Nickname" you give the feed you follow_) twice; Then it appears in your timeline twice. This is weird! 😳
2020-07-28T21:02:30Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> Hey ! 👋 I made a bunch of comments on the "twtxt.net API" specs dos we're working on that will form the basis of an API that will (_as a first use-case_) drive a new iOS App. LMK if/when you think we have enough details ironed out to start working on a prototype! 😎
2020-07-28T23:35:35Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re reuse)  Whenever I do development I was trying to reuse the best possible eyebrows I can find. If I can’t find anything suitable then I’ll write it myself! 😁
2020-07-28T23:39:07Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re external accounts on timeline ) if by this you mean from another twtxt instance, then yes. There are plans in the works to do instance <->instance interactions, but this is the responsibility of the backend itself.
2020-07-28T23:41:28Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re permalinks and hashes) possibly but using a cryptographic hash is probably better and more future proof
2020-07-29T03:10:11Z	📣 **FYI:** Okay folks. I'm going to update [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) with the following significant bugs/features [#41](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/41) and [#46](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/46) 🎉 I hope nothing terribly goes wrong with the upgrade! 🤞
2020-07-29T03:13:30Z	Hahaha 🤣😂 Re « Trump’s Plan To Regulate Social Media ⌘ http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/8XpNFJ-ikm8/trumps-plan-to-regulate-social-media » Good luck with regulating self-hosted, decentralised social media like [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😉
2020-07-29T03:15:09Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re external accounts on twtxt.net timeline) Umm perhaps we need to chat about this a bit more. It _might_ actually be a good idea if we have that video conf we talked about 🤔 Just so I can share my vision and we can be on the same page and meet each other? ...
2020-07-29T03:15:52Z	@antonia (re twtxt client I use); I actually dog food my own creation and use [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) primarily d'uh :) 🤣 I use it both on Desktop and on iOS (_even though there's no shiny app yet!_) 😀
2020-07-29T03:25:51Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re video conf) Cool! I'll book it in and send you c a cal invite :)
2020-07-29T03:26:51Z	Okay here we go ... New version of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤞
2020-07-29T03:54:17Z	🎉 **NEW:** Great news [twtxt.net[(https://twtxt.net) and all you Twters! Inline link rendering on the platform is now more consistent! 🤞Even better news, sessions are now persistent and last longer (_up to 10days_). No more getting logged out frequency! 👌
2020-07-29T04:10:00Z	Ahh this is great not having to login again each time I do a new deployment of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😎
2020-07-29T04:14:52Z	@antonia Actually I don't seem to be able to view your email address on either your [Github Profile](https://github.com/aaadonai) or your [Website](https://antonio.is/)? Perhaps you can shot me an email? `prologic at shortcircuit dot net dot au`

2020-07-29T07:26:49Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re thing) Oh? From Twtxt?! How is that meant to work?!
2020-07-29T07:39:16Z	❓ What to do with _potentially inactive accounts_? 🤔
2020-07-29T07:51:35Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re !bangs) Yes I realise :) I was just trying to understand what intent and/or meaning it has in the (_now ever growing_) Twtxt community?
2020-07-29T07:59:25Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re panic buying) Oh now c'mon! 🤣 Don't fighten the por little dears 😂 #covid19

2020-07-29T10:56:04Z	😳 My ISP today (_who shall remain nameless_) said to me: "You are downloading all the time! Of course your Internet will be slow!" -- Well d'uh, it's called running a #home_datacenter in a very nice server room with a 19" 22RU Rack Cabinet. Guess what my response was? 🤔
2020-07-29T11:21:30Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> re (using Internet) Hahahahaha 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 I know right! How dare someone with ~20yrs of industry experience use a Fibre backed, Copper via VDSL2+ hand off for something other than your boring 'ol "surf the Interwebs" 😛
2020-07-29T13:00:06Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re another twtxt client); No don't feel dumb! On the contrary the more the merrier! 🎉 #twtxt
2020-07-29T21:16:33Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re external twtxt users/feeds) Nope!  🤣 That  was a core feature from Day 1 :) This just means you're starting to amass a following and followers 😎 [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) _might_ just be starting to have "critical mass"? 🤔
2020-07-29T21:22:20Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive twtxt.txt file) Yes. In fact I insist. Very soon [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) will have (_configurable ofc_) an option to limit the size of `twtxt.txt1 feeds it is allowed to fetch. I've done some math and figured a good default before rotation is around ~2MB...
2020-07-29T21:25:53Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> Yeah sorry about that! I made a mistake in the code at one point and accidentally nuked all feeds 😢 It won't happen again! I'll be making sure to implement a backup job to ensure feeds are backed up.
2020-07-29T22:55:18Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> twt) Yeah I look forward to it each day too now, its kind of exciting! 😎
2020-07-30T00:32:33Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> Oh poo 💩 No new users since yesterday! C'mon guys and gals!

2020-07-30T02:58:59Z	💡New feature ideas: a) A "Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)" for new visitors. b) Photo/Image uploads c) More automated feed bots

Although that being said, I have plans to integrate Video Uploads (_as well as Photo/Image uploads_) into [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net). The Video/Photo will come first! 🎉 (cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt>)

2020-07-30T05:17:59Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re video/image uploads) Yes! 🤣 But don't worry I've written most of the code already in various other side-projects 😎

Enjoy! 🤗 Need help? Just post a Twt and tag @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> 🤞
2020-07-30T06:15:49Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) I _believe_ there is already a convention by this I've seen around the twtxt community. That is to rename the active `twtxt.txt` file to `twtxt-<YYYY>.txt`. I would implement the exact same behaviour for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)'s backend too. Thoughts?
2020-07-30T06:37:34Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) Yeah I _think_ we should stick to the same conventions. Speaking of which, at some point I'm going to start thinking about taking over the twtxt Spec and adding to it over time (_with joint efforts/discussions with the community of course_).
2020-07-30T06:38:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) I had a discussion with @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> about old feeds and basically the consensus was that as humans we probably don't really care too much about things older than ~6 months or so. We can just auto-archive old feeds here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net). Easy.
2020-07-30T06:39:53Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) Users in the wider community of course are welcome to make old twtxt feeds available as feeds of them own if they wish. No-one is forced to fetch them of course. Can do the same here too.
2020-07-30T07:41:35Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) Let's file an [Issue](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/new) and discuss this in more detail there? (cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt>) My gut instinct tells me to just archive old feeds out with a `[.-][0-9]{4,6}` suffix...
2020-07-30T07:42:32Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) And leave it up to Users to continue to "Host" the old feed if they wish. This _may_ also happen similarly on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) as well and may be backend configurable and/or user controlled settings.
2020-07-30T07:43:29Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Mars Rover and your name?!) Say what? What did I miss in the world today? 🤣
2020-07-30T08:36:24Z	@<lesley https://twtxt.net/user/lesley/twtxt.txt> Hello! I can't believe I didn't reply to you! What a terrible person I am :)
2020-07-30T10:19:44Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re your twtxt instance) oh that would be wonderful! I look forward to it as well be able to grow the network of interconnected twtxt instances ! 🎉 also UI/UX improvements are always welcome
2020-07-30T10:37:51Z	@<recipes https://twtxt.net/user/recipes/twtxt.txt> (cc @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt>) Your Twts are really quite clever and engaging! Keep it up! 😎 I hope your new feed @<local_wonders https://twtxt.net/user/local_wonders/twtxt.txt> will be just as good when we have a Photo/Image upload feature (_coming soon™ to a [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) instance near you!_) 🙇‍♂️
2020-07-30T10:40:17Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re archive) Yeah from a  [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) backend perspective it won't matter "how" users in the wider community archive their old feeds -- as long as they do as no sensible backend should fetch feeds that grow indefinitely.
2020-07-30T12:06:15Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-07-30T12:08:14Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re using this right) Yup you are :) Check out [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) for interesting local and external feeds to follow, as well as users. Other ways to discover new users is via the internal @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> bot and @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> bot posts once per day on the instance's statsl
2020-07-30T12:08:51Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> You already have two followers 😎
2020-07-30T20:27:59Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re feed persisting) Yeah 🤣 As I said (_and apologised!_); I had a bug 🐞 in a production data migration that truncated all _sub_Feeds 😢 It shan't happen again 🤗
2020-07-30T21:03:02Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re mastodon instance) Hmmm I dunno about Mastodon to be honest. Something about it doesn't fit right with me 😛 In any case I noticed something: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5qZXr8L) -- Should we include Blog/Website/etc in [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) profiles? 🤔
2020-07-30T21:03:59Z	That was suppose to be an inline image damnit ![](https://imgur.com/5qZXr8L)
2020-07-30T21:04:21Z	Imgur sucks 🤣
2020-07-30T21:15:56Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt cli client) Where's the source again? I'll check it out :)
2020-07-31T00:34:29Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re regexes) Hahaha 🤣 😂 I have the same problem in trying to improve the `[Reply]` feature of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😂 Regexes are HARD!
2020-07-31T02:26:13Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re weather) 😳 what part of the world do you live in?! 🔥
2020-07-31T03:24:45Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> (re weather) Apparently its hot somewhere in the world! Like blazingly hot! 🔥Right @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> ? 😀
2020-07-31T03:25:32Z	@<mikerob82 https://twtxt.net/user/mikerob82/twtxt.txt> (re photography gear) Sounds like you need to save up and buy new gear? 📷
2020-07-31T03:26:44Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re double Twt!) No worries :) Its okay and no we probably don't have a "delete Twt" feature I don't think. Maybe? Hmmm 🤔 Not sure... It _might_ make sense to allow an edit or delete of your very last Twt? But the file backend is more like a WAL (_Write Ahead Log_)
2020-07-31T03:29:19Z	@<phoenix https://twtxt.net/user/phoenix/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)! Happy to have you join our community! 🤗 You can find interesting feeds and users to follow on [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) 🤞 If you need any help just tag me (@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) or Twt and tag @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> 👍
2020-07-31T03:32:29Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> Now that you've fixed the "Followers" of feeds such as @<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt>, etc... I now see that there are only 4 users that follow the internal event feed @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> 🤣
2020-07-31T04:22:10Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re disabling Post button) Actually that's a great idea! Can you do this? 🤗 My only requirement (_as you can see_) is that we don't introduce any "heavy" JS and that any JS **must** degrade gracefully.
2020-07-31T04:23:30Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re contributing to wtxt.net) Really happy to have you on board in more ways than one! ❤️
2020-07-31T05:38:16Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re not American!) Hahahah 🤣 😂 Good! @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> I _think_ you might have bad an _assumption_ that was a bit off 😛
2020-07-31T05:39:07Z	Although that being said, Americans are welcome here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) And as this grows there will be more instances in the `twtxt` network to choose from, and you can always run your own! 😎
2020-07-31T07:53:20Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re imgur) Yeah hopefully by tonight (_or this weekend at the latest_) [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) will have a  new endpoint and builtin feature whereby users can upload photos/images as part of their Twt. 🎉
2020-07-31T07:54:31Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re new avatar) Also nice new Avatar of yourself, love it that folks here are getting on top of new features being rapidly built out! (cc @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> you can also do the same as well!) 🤗
2020-07-31T08:10:02Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> Hey! 👋 You have 4 followers now 😎
2020-07-31T09:47:19Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re following @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt>) Were you perhaps following his @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> feed and got confused? 😊
2020-07-31T09:48:54Z	@<yeast https://twtxt.net/user/yeast/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 Glad to have you join our ever growing community! 🎉 If you need any help just post a `Twt` and tag `@<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt>`. Check out [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) for interesting users and feeds to follow! Welcome!
2020-07-31T10:04:52Z	@doovan Yes let's disable the `Post` button once "clicked". Maybe rename it to `Twt` while you're at it 😎
2020-07-31T10:58:54Z	@<Evil_Bob https://codemadness.org/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋
2020-07-31T12:53:45Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re syndicating twtxt to atom) What are you trying to do?
2020-07-31T13:37:22Z	Testing double accidental posting :)
2020-07-31T13:37:42Z	It works™ 😎
2020-07-31T13:39:02Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt on micro.blog) The reason I was curious and asked... Is because I did it the other way around. e.g: https://feeds.twtxt.net/prologic_blog/twtxt.txt
2020-07-31T15:14:31Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re do people blog?) I don't really have much time to write proper long-form blogs. I do however have [my blog](https://prologic.blog) which can be followed via twtxt. But yeah I much prefer using [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) now 😎
2020-07-31T15:17:46Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re terminal fonts) I use this one ![](https://i.imgur.com/1t6hjzq.png)
2020-07-31T20:25:21Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> 👋 Yup it is. Shouldn’t feeds also have their own avatar hmmmm 🤔
2020-07-31T20:32:03Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re Fossil) I hear only good things about Fossil. I use Gitea myself 👌
2020-07-31T20:41:59Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt to RSS) no I don’t know od such a service, however; if one were to be created you can imagine that you end up in an infinite loop cycle between the three different systems responsible if you happen to create a feed that feeds itself! Ouch 😂
2020-07-31T20:56:32Z	@<flavienbwk https://twtxt.net/user/flavienbwk/twtxt.txt> (re Avatars) No they actually do work... However I realise now I have a problem with the backend. I have not implementing cache control in any sensible way shape or form 😢 So CloudFlare is by default caching everything for ~4hrs. @doovan Do you want to help fix this with me?
2020-07-31T20:57:56Z	@<flavienbwk https://twtxt.net/user/flavienbwk/twtxt.txt> (re caching) Probably several endpoints or more need to have appropriate `Cache-Control` headers and _some_ probably also need `ETag` headers. I just _haven't_ thought about this yet. Been developing [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) rapidly! (cc @doovan @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt>)
2020-07-31T21:01:10Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> Nice new Avatar there 😎 Problem is you've somehow managed to make one of your feeds Avatar's change 🤔 Which leads me to the thinking "Hmmm I _think_ Feeds need their own Avatar as well 🤔"
2020-07-31T22:14:37Z	Just had a great chat with @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and the vision and plans for the new upcoming Mobile/iOS App! 🎉 Exciting stuff! Really looking forward to working with Antonio on this 😎 Going to spend the day/weekend working on an API v1 for the backend...
2020-07-31T22:16:52Z	With all this hype/crap lately on TikTok™ (_Microsoft is thinking of buying it? wtf/!_); What you _should_ know is that there is a Twtxt feed called [TikTok](https://enotty.dk/tiktok.txt) which I personally follow as it helps break up my timeline. It basically Twts the time ⏰every ½hr 🤣
2020-08-01T00:51:19Z	@<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> Hello ! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 So happy for you to join us! 🎉 If you have any q's tag me (@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) or ask @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt>. Check out @<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> and @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> and also [/feeds](https://twtxt.net) for things to follow 😀
2020-08-01T00:52:43Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re caching) Cool! If you can help me solve this that would be awesome, I didn't implement caching properly yet :/
2020-08-01T00:54:23Z	So it would appear that according to @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> « 🧮 USERS:70 FEEDS:10 POSTS:620 » we're not growing in users now... But that's okay. But we are growing in "activity" 🎉 Hopefully having an iOS app will help grow the user base as well as having other interested users spin up their own!
2020-08-01T01:07:33Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re Shopping)... What you mean like _shitty_ [Bunnings](https://www.bunnings.com.au/) that has basically **zero** customer service?! 🤣
2020-08-01T01:09:31Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re Spamming me) HAHA 🤣 😂 Spam away! It's a good thing we haven't built out [Mentions & Notifications](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/13) yet or I'd get a bit annoying with my Mobile/Desktop getting Web Push notifications all day from you 😛
2020-08-01T02:28:40Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re NSW no. plates) Haha! To you NSW(er) would you please kindly go back to your respective state until the recent COVID-19 contamination of QLD has creased! 🤣 (_no offence !_)
2020-08-01T07:56:40Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re long weekend!) Nice! What's your weekend plans?
2020-08-01T07:59:25Z	I was discussing with @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> on good idea for other automated feeds (_bots_) and a @world_stats was suggested based on the data that comes from [World o Meters](https://www.worldometers.info/) -- Unfortunately it costs an insane amount of 💵 to get access to their APIs 😐
2020-08-01T11:02:43Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> PR [#58](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/pull/68) is up that improves how `[Reply]` works. If you feel like taking a look at it?
2020-08-01T20:46:26Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re marketing inventions) There are two really good ways to do this in modern times 😎 [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) or [Kickstarter](https://www.indiegogo.com/) -- Basically "crowd funding". You need only a working prototype, some nice video demo, etc...
2020-08-01T20:48:12Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re GOPATH) Yeah no worries! Its' just when you run `go install <blah>` it will put the binary in `$HOME/go/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin` (_if I'm no mistaken); But don't do development on any of my stuff inside `$GOPATH`, I use Go111Modules so its not necessary 😀
2020-08-01T20:49:24Z	Hmmm should we put the timeline pager at the top as well for convenience on Web? 🤔
2020-08-01T22:19:54Z	🎉 **NEW:** As of today you can now upload your favourite pics 📸 and Twt about them! Just like this one 😎 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/3DDDTt3AH6DLZ3VF5NXViZ.png) There _might_ be a few quirks/bugs so please let us know by tagging @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> or filing an issue!

2020-08-01T22:45:06Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> I just get a blank page?! ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Y4LW8vcm6RP9LDU8oB5ABX.png)
2020-08-01T23:01:28Z	📣 **FYI:** Fix a bug 🐞 with the new media 📸 upload capabilities 😎 Enjoy!
2020-08-01T23:07:12Z	Test  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/sdgBxgYwGjYFxDaAF4s2FE.png)
2020-08-01T23:16:57Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> how would you like to be a guinea pig for showing your own custom avatar on this platform [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😎
2020-08-01T23:17:51Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Microsoft <-> TikTok) yeah it seems ridiculous that companies just buy other companies out and sometimes it just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!
2020-08-01T23:18:24Z	Can you reply button is working fantastically! 🎉
2020-08-01T23:18:54Z	The new*
2020-08-01T23:20:20Z	@<mox https://tilde.town/~mox/twtxt.txt> yes I believe you’re talking about custom domain name hosting? That will be coming soon and I think we worked out the details…
2020-08-01T23:41:41Z	What a beautiful gorgeous day!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/39mnbKhQZDQUkiGhLJYav8.png)
2020-08-01T23:43:34Z	⚠️ If the new media upload feature doesn’t work for existing users please clear your browser cache and try again!
2020-08-01T23:55:34Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re first post from API) Oh how exciting !!! 🎉😎😍
2020-08-02T00:04:50Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> having fun? Is this from a prototype mobile app?! 😎
2020-08-02T00:09:48Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re prototyping) yeah I’ll spend today working on some more and points for you for sure! What kind points would you like me to build immediately? Pick two 😁
2020-08-02T00:11:12Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re prototyping) how soon can you put the prototype up on test pilot so that I can try it out as well and we can eat right quickly!? (just remember the name of the damn thing!)
2020-08-02T00:15:59Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> wgoohoo 2 new users and hundreds of Twts!!!
2020-08-02T00:48:48Z	My five-year-old daughter just threw this in our local café!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/7hCZkdfcoXEj2EAV7Z57nm.png)
2020-08-02T00:50:12Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re next endpoints) I will get these done by my time today (AEST)
2020-08-02T00:50:57Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re first beta version) sounds good! I think the sooner we can test him if I write all ideas and feature sets the better before publishing it to the App Store 😁
2020-08-02T00:51:24Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re testing app) Good point!
2020-08-02T02:12:01Z	Just in case no-one _thought_ this was slowly bur surely taking off... 😎  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/srsBT6yewCzu7UccP8Um5B.png)

2020-08-02T05:23:00Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt>  New `/api/v1/discover` endpoint deployed. 🎉
2020-08-02T05:47:40Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re-avatar) Basically if you put up an `avatar.png` at the same Base URI location as your `twtxt.txt` feed; I _should_ be able to teach [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) to show you a pretty mug shot of yourself rather than this:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/fu6M5YPgD5NGqdfS74wpRK.png)
2020-08-02T05:51:23Z	Ahhh a lovely Sunday beer !  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/mcnDaj6AE2ktUVxbR7H8JQ.png)
2020-08-02T06:15:46Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> **NEW:** `/api/v1/follow` endpoint deployed! 🎉
2020-08-02T06:16:28Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Sunday beer) Cheers mate! 🍻
2020-08-02T06:43:23Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re-avatar) Okay here's what you do... (_NB: I haven't built this feature yet..._). Your [twtxt feed](https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt) just needs to have an ![https://hjertnes.social/avatar.png](https://hjertnes.social/avatar.png) next to it alongside the same Base URI.
2020-08-02T07:19:32Z	@<fegffb https://feg-ffb.de/twtxt.txt> That site (https://feg-ffb.de/2020/08/02/wochenspruch-32-2020/) is _really_ slow to load... Also its completely in German... What is it? 🤣
2020-08-02T07:21:15Z	Not sure if @<fegffb https://feg-ffb.de/twtxt.txt> _actually_ posts in the future or not 🤣 or whether the server infra that powers [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is "out of sync" 😎  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Y7TzSTUHmn6iGMhseCqF7J.png)
2020-08-02T08:45:45Z	@<shahzeb https://twtxt.net/user/shahzeb/twtxt.txt> Hey! Thanks for updating your avatar! 😎 Also thanks for your work/effort so far on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net). You did a good job with the Password Reset and Media Upload features! 🎉 Let's get the CSS improved on Mobile soon! 😀
2020-08-02T10:10:28Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re external avatars) Hmmm 🤔 Now I'm confused... What's `$twtxt_basename` in this case? Can you give an example of a whole UIR? And btw I meant if you have for example `domain.tld/twtxt.txt` and `domain.tld/avatar.png`...
2020-08-02T10:29:34Z	@<cosmix https://twtxt.net/user/cosmix/twtxt.txt> (re grouping high volume feeds) Yeah I actually had to _Unfollow_ the [ShowHN](https://enotty.dk/showhn.txt) feed as it was _becoming_ too noisy for me and _somewhat_ uninteresting.
2020-08-02T10:30:26Z	@<cosmix https://twtxt.net/user/cosmix/twtxt.txt> (re grouping high volume feeds) One interesting counter idea would be to create subFeeds that turn high-volume feeds into smaller / less noisy ones with "various" algos. 🤔
2020-08-02T11:56:49Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re 😺 spam) Haha! It's either a "Hello World!" for a new Programming Language or "Cat Pictures" for a ny Web App right? 🤣
2020-08-02T12:32:12Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re 😺 spam) I know right :) Rather convenient I think to be able to preserve what I've noticed is "by convention" in the greater twtxt community 😎
2020-08-02T14:29:16Z	Came across a [forum thread](https://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/15824721) from https://linux.org.ru this evening talking about [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_this thing I built!_); Unfortunately I had to translate Russian into English so I _may_ have misunderstood some of the convo.
2020-08-02T14:31:14Z	Re ([forum thread](https://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/15824721) from https://linux.org.ru) However I would encourage (_if anyone from linux.org.ru sees this_) to read my blog posts on https://prologic.blog/ for why, how I created this and where its going! Thanks for talking about it!
2020-08-02T21:28:08Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (i hate regex) Yup me too! They're a giant PITA to get right 🤬

2020-08-02T22:07:54Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Testing) Whatcha testing there? 😊
2020-08-02T22:54:51Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Testing) Ahh brilliant :) I'm just refactoring the template handling atm, probably saw the commit :)
2020-08-02T23:32:56Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> Thanks !
2020-08-02T23:37:22Z	This is what happens when a 35lb recurve bow with a normal carbon fibre arrow with field point hits a 1.6 mm it’s a plate steel on the back of the gate! 🏹  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gxyE4zVqx8Gob94huPp77Y.png)
2020-08-03T00:18:08Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> If you're bored 🤣 And itching for some cool things to do; I'd love to see a [/@mtnions](https://twtxt.net/mentions) handler/endpoint as well as #hashtag parsing/searching. It would also be nice to be able to (_say as a Post/Twt action_) "Only show Posts/Twts from this source _)
2020-08-03T00:19:25Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re filtering by source) Consider you follow ~100+ feeds (_like I do! 😂_) it is a useful thing to be able to say "Just show me all the Slashdot Twts for now", then later "Show me all the ShowHN Twts", etc.
2020-08-03T00:20:52Z	Also if anyone is any good (_better than me, as I'm rubbish_), the CSS can do with a bit of cleanup especially for smaller devices like on Mobile. Especially the Media Upload / Post As look. The "Home" / '"Timeline" top left is a bit off too IHMO.
2020-08-03T00:35:09Z	Re ([twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) UI/UX) I _think_ we just need to have a _small_ row of buttons along the top of this text box with basic buttons for Markdown formatting and the "Media Upload". What do you think? It'll have to be custom made though as anything I've found is unsuitable.
2020-08-03T03:33:40Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re filtering by source) Oh nice! Done! Created [#77](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/77) #78 and #79 if you're interested 😎
2020-08-03T04:13:31Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> Are you on Signal btw? If not can you be? I'd love  to keep in touch a bit more regularly (_if we can, in our **spare** time of course!_) as some interesting things have come up related to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) Also cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> you too 😎
2020-08-03T04:24:04Z	Check out my feed @<home_datacenter https://twtxt.net/user/home_datacenter/twtxt.txt> where I will be posting a series of Twt(s) on building, running and maintaining your own Home Datacenter / Private Cloud. Your own infrastructure. 🤗 👨‍💻

2020-08-03T05:42:44Z	WOW! 😲 We've done something right this week! 🎉 This particular Pod (_I think we're going to call them Pods 🤗_) has spiked in the last few days. Something to do with the fact we now have Custom Avatars and Media Uploads? 🤔  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/rBBpub786a6gjQj8aTv5mB.png)
2020-08-03T05:44:29Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Signal) Yeah no worries! I'll shoot my no. through to you in a sec. We should all get together and collaborate a bit more in real-time (_when we can_). Also let's not (_as I said_) pollute this Pod with "Development" back 'n forth 🤣 -- Have a few things to share...

2020-08-03T07:42:11Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> happy Monday to you too! 🤗
2020-08-03T07:47:13Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> hahahaha 🤣😂🤣😂 Yeah sometimes I try my hand at astrophotography, but it’s been a while 🤔
2020-08-03T07:56:15Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re shoutout) Oh so terribly sorry! I’ll fix that! What is your Github username for reference?
2020-08-03T08:07:19Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re shoutout) Fixed! Sorry about that 🤣
2020-08-03T08:13:07Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re API) Yup the `/api/v1` endpoints are already live and working for auth, timeline, discover and follow. I'll be adding more endpoints this week or tonight (_depending on how tired I am 🤣_) I've mostly just been adding stuff that @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> needs. Also a thought... a `/micropub`?
2020-08-03T08:25:18Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re unfollowed a bunch of folks on the same  domain) twtxt.net? 🥱 If so sorry; this is new and its all exciting and we're building something (_hopefully awesome_)! 🤗 Open to ideas from you!
2020-08-03T09:37:03Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re hitting feeds too hard) What's your Github Username? Can you check out [#83](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/83) -- Specifically you don't have any issues with [twtxt.net](https://twtx.net) hitting your feed too hard/often/etc?

Please share your ideas 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-03T20:55:17Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Monday gibes) I love it! 😍Speaking of which... We need a community manager on this Pod 😎 Hmmm 🤔 cc @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> 😂

2020-08-03T23:56:47Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Ansible) Nice! Speaking of which... Aren't you still planning on spinning up another instance (_I think we're going to call 'em Pods_) of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net). I'd love to work with you on this and get some more Pod<->Pod features working and fleshed out... 😎
2020-08-04T00:15:25Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re instance) Nice! I'll even pay for the hosting/domain for you if you like 😎
2020-08-04T00:15:44Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re instance) Within reason of course Haha!

Also no worries re Unfollow, I _thought_ for a minute there was a. bug in the backend, I was like wtf?! How is @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> following me twice today from the same client 😛

2020-08-04T02:20:49Z	Interesting blog piece on the "Fediverse" at large and [ActivityPub](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/). Good read. I _think_ this is something worth exploring for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) but its still not clear to me which *Pub we support.
2020-08-04T04:32:11Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> (re Marmalade) Please do share the end result when it’s all nice and ready! please do share the end result when it’s all nice and ready!🤗📷
2020-08-04T05:09:48Z	**FYI** (_to dev community_); Put up https://dev.twtxt.net to start documenting things as we gain more developers to the project. In general we're moving development discussions away from here, trying not to break it as more users find it new, exciting, useful and fun! 🎉😎💪

2020-08-04T07:04:38Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re Federation) Go on... is there a hint of something in your Twt re say twtxt.net say? 😁
2020-08-04T08:51:59Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re Federation) TBH I'm not sure what I'm planning for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) in terms of "Federation" either (yet)... Some in the dev community are hinting that I should explore `ActivityPub` / `MicroPub`. I'm not sure yet, possibly. Anyway what are your opinions?
2020-08-04T08:52:58Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Can't you just tell your boss you're too busy with more important things?

2020-08-04T12:16:07Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> Do you mind comment on [How does twtxt comparison to Mastodon?](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/86) and sharing your insights? I tend to agree with you in some ways, I've looked into the AP spec a bit and find it a bit complex. MicroPub I'm still very hazy on... ]
2020-08-04T20:51:25Z	@<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 So happy to have you join our growing twtxt community! Check out [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) for interesting feeds and other folks to follow and [/discover](https://twtxt.net/discover) for all Twts of local users.
2020-08-04T20:53:08Z	@<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt.txt feed URI) Yes! Just append `twtxt.txt` to your user profile URI. E.g: https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt -- We _had_ a link in the User profile view  but removed it as I _thought_ it would confuse people. Not sure where else we can expose it right now
2020-08-04T20:59:08Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Netlify) I don't get it 🤣 Doesn't Netlify just do (_basically_) web hosting and such?
2020-08-04T20:59:49Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (Netlify) How do I find myself?! 😲
2020-08-04T21:50:05Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (Netlify) Weird I can't click on anything 🤣  Oh well  😂
2020-08-04T21:51:44Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Netlify hosting) Ahh! Yeah I just take advantage of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for that. Similar idea I guess? We use Netlify (_or used to_) at our company (_in my day job_); I guess it's "Okay", not so keen on their pricing model though...
2020-08-04T22:27:20Z	lukem (re Netlify hosting) Yeah fair ehough. Good reason to use Netfliy. I guess I typically self-host, but that's just a choice, not a technical thing at all :)
2020-08-05T02:31:29Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re work) Hah! Maybe share some of it around?! 😛

2020-08-05T07:13:26Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re unit tests & refactoring) Would you be interested in putting that passion towards [twtxt](https://twtxt.net)’a codebase? 😁
2020-08-05T08:10:57Z	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (re messy forms) Oh what the hell?! It took like ~2mins for that page to load! 🤣 I don't even want to click around on thebottomss now 😂
2020-08-05T12:38:31Z	Why do these micro-blogging platforms like [Twitter](https://twitter.com)™, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), even [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) limit the no. of characters of your Tweet/Toot/Twt? What's the "technical" reason? What's the "design" choice? 🤔
2020-08-05T13:45:05Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re char. limits) And so... What's our "technical" limit for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)?! I can only _think_ if "feed size", "bandwidth" from fetching clients, etc... The character limits has a direct impact on when you rotate your feed out too... Thoughts?
2020-08-05T13:52:55Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re char. limits) Well it is a configuration option anyway in the `twtd` backend. So that's fine. I _was thinking_ however of increasing the limit of this particular Pod/instance... To say `576`. 🤔
2020-08-05T14:19:57Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re pool and pool fence) Hopefully next week in fact! 🏖
2020-08-05T14:20:24Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re char. limits) Correct.
2020-08-05T14:21:27Z	Seems like Docker Swarm hosting is a non-existent thing now (_everyone has moved to k8s 😳_); trouble is managed k8s is actually a bit hefty in price 😢
2020-08-05T15:15:09Z	Did anyone on the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) platform notice the **NEW** 🎉 [/mentions](https://twtxt.net/mension) feature? 🤔 😎
2020-08-05T20:44:21Z	@<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re mentions) Yeah I guess its only useful when the Pod gets busier/noiser and you yourself follow more feeds.
2020-08-05T20:45:11Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re char limit) Well I'm probably going to reconfigure this Pod's `MaxTwtLength` to `576` today.
2020-08-05T20:47:27Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re k8s) Yeah I still use [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) myself and run several production clusters. Thinking of doing the same for [Hosted twtxt Pods](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/87) mostly to save costs but also simplicity. 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-05T21:53:53Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re Google+ class action) Is that it⁉️ Is that all the compensation  you get as a person in this world if your Data Privacy and Digital Footprint is violated⁉️😱
2020-08-05T21:55:38Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re bug, spam) Details please  :) Do you mean to say that _anyone_ can register, then just post whatever⁉️😎If so that's intentional; at _some_ point we _may_ have to think about "proof" that you are a human 😎 -- But that's more of an operator of a Pod type thing ... 🤔

2020-08-05T22:49:37Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> Rx == React? Yeah I find the whole idea of  `diff-patch` of the DOM quite a nice little concept, but somehow Facebook engineers had to turn it into complex vastly more complex and hard to use 😢
2020-08-06T05:05:27Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re 🐕💩) No! No! No! No! Its my new 🏹 range goddamnit! 🤣
2020-08-06T07:49:20Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> I noticed you don't follow any feeds or users. By following users you discover through [/discover](https://twtxt.net/discover) or external feeds/users from [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) you get a personalised timeline 😎
2020-08-06T07:52:17Z	Heard through the "grapevine" today that [Twitter](https://twitter.com)™ _removed_ Mr. Trump's account finally 😳 I must say, who the hell gives Twitter or anyone for that matter the _right_ to silence anyone let alone poor Mr. Trump (_even if he is ill perceived and allegedly says questionable things at times_). **NO ONE!** 😡
2020-08-06T08:17:49Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re Trump's account reinstated) So apparently society can't make up their own minds about what _may_ or _may not_ be the truth about anything anymore? Have we really become that "switched off" from reality⁉️ 🤔
2020-08-06T11:06:39Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> re (React/ / Rx) Yeah I can't really say I've used either really. I'm also not a frontend dev (_never have been, nor have I claimed to every be!_); so its a bit unfair for my to compare. What I do know is UI/UX interactions are hard to get right, get complicated real fast and whilst I understand the basic idea behind React -- Diff-Patch; I never really could wrap my head around React -- But that's not React's fault, I just can't wrap my head around UI/UX! 😳
2020-08-06T11:58:16Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (tools solving the _right_ job); Yeah I agree. I personally (_and this is just a personal choice after ~15-20yrs of experience, and having written one myself_) don't like to use "frameworks" myself. I deliberately picked certain components for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_possibly as the detriment of attracting developers to the project 🤔_); but nonetheless these can be found documented at https://dev.twtxt.net/
2020-08-06T12:46:05Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Yeah I like to keep things simple :)
2020-08-06T14:16:08Z	I'm giving Mastodon a serious go tonight and paid for a Managed Hosted instance. I'm `prologic@mastodon.mills.io`. I've explored quite a fair bit of the signup process, flows and feature set so far. The good news 🎉 is that [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is **NOT** just yet another Mastodon, and there are already _significant_ differences which I'm taking note of. For example it seems quite hard to find users or interesting feeds to follow (_despite it being federated_) 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-06T14:32:03Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re iOS app for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)) Oh nice! 😎 Can't wait to have an early working version 🤗
2020-08-06T15:01:49Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Yes! Discovery as it turns out is "quite hard". And IHMO (_and I could be wrong here_); but I don't think Mastodon has done a better job of that. We (twtxt.net) plan to try to solve this in new and interesting ways for sure! The fact that [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) already knows how to pull in external feed sources under [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) already helps immensely. As well each pod's local timeline gets a special @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> feed that is another way ti discover either new users, feeds or who's following who. Important subtle differences !
2020-08-06T15:13:29Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re Mastodon) Oh that's cool! I guess the moment you started following me at my Mastodon URI my server instance nows knows about the one you're one and I could find you in the "Profile Directory" and follow you back.
2020-08-06T21:09:01Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Yup that’s the plan
2020-08-06T21:46:26Z	🥱 Good Morning World! 👋
2020-08-06T23:32:11Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> API has been refactored a bit, tested a fair bit this morning, with bugs fixes. Updated the docs at https://dev.twtxt.net/
2020-08-07T00:14:52Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> I wonder who's going to make the 1,000th Twt⁉️ 🤔 🤣
2020-08-07T00:19:17Z	@<tknz https://twtxt.net/user/tknz/twtxt.txt> Why hello there! 👋 I didn't notice you had signed up and posted your first Twt  this morning (_for me anyway_) in my half-asleep uncaffinated state of mind 🤣 -- Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) ❕Check out [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) for interesting users and feeds to follow. Also consider following @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> for daily stats on this Pod and @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> for internal events where you can also discover new users! Feel free to tag me @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> if you have any q's. Enjoy! 😎
2020-08-07T00:22:01Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API) Also building a CLI (_UNIX style_) client as well that uses the same API. This will take inspiration from [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) (_and others maybe_), but I want it to be as simple to use as `echo "Hello World" | twt` 😎
2020-08-07T00:28:56Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re CLI UNIX style) Not quite sure what you mean exactly... Bad clients, abuses? We _should_ definitely rate limit it.
2020-08-07T00:42:11Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API keys / limits) Ahh yes I see what you mean. This is more compliated, but doable. I _believe_ what you are referring to is what we fall Application/Device tokens. I _think_ OAuth does this by design if I'm not mistaken. I _would_ just implement OAuth if I was actually familiar enough in "implemtnation detail" (_I understand the flows_); but anyway, maybe someone can come along and refactor API auth and/or add OAuth. Can you write up an issue re App tokens? I _think_ we'd need them to be "Pod Operator" managed? 🤔
2020-08-07T00:42:45Z	@<news_feed https://twtxt.net/user/news_feed/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Feed Avatars) Yes! This is just a missing enhancement. It will/should be done :)
2020-08-07T01:33:31Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API keys / limits) Yeah that's kind of my point. I _think_ we can easily limit API reqest rates at an individual pod level, an operator is also free to  put further measures in place of course at their network level, and our own hosted offering will also have similar infra. The other thing to think about is to make req/res as cheap as possible to limit the impact of an attack. All important factors. Of course having it behind Cloudflare also helps :D
2020-08-07T01:33:45Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> You work too much!
2020-08-07T03:10:56Z	😲 This pod ([twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) has _almost_ reached 0.5M hits over the past month! 😳  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/UrjA8SS8y9S9SvYzKEsRB5.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tnaSStB4EQkq4vuoXtsDpG.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/VyZz93P9pASmeKpSyPKGcb.png)
2020-08-07T04:11:47Z	@<rell https://twtxt.net/user/rell/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 So glad you can join our growing twtxt community! 🙇‍♂️ Check out [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) for interesting external users and feeds to follow! Also consider following the special feeds @<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> for news and updates on this Pod and @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> for internal events (_where you can discover who follows you, new users, etc_). If you need any help feel free to tag me @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> in a Twt Enjoy! 😎
2020-08-07T04:41:18Z	@<rell https://twtxt.net/user/rell/twtxt.txt> (re Launch!) That was approximately ~3weeks ago now this Sunday😎 But thanks! 🙇‍♂️ I _believe_ we're very quickly approaching 100 Users on this Pod and nearly 0.5M hits this month. Now we just need to build out the "federation" (_think Pods talking to each other_) features and get some willing volunteers 😀
2020-08-07T05:59:03Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re cURL and XML) Context? 🤣
2020-08-07T06:00:17Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> (re MicroPub) Yeah from what I know of using MicroPub and reading source-code that implement it (_I need to go read the spec again_); I _think_ adding MicroPub support to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) _may_ make sense.
2020-08-07T22:06:32Z	Anyone on  a WIndows machine with Internet Explorer or cn easily get access to one to help fix a bug on this platform? If so please tag me (@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) and have a look at this [Issue](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/96) 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-07T22:59:26Z	Test testing the IE bug I fixed :)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/j9WLem8aVk8DwMLsGd7mrd.png)
2020-08-07T23:06:12Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> I fixed that bug _I think_; looks like the "Upload Media" was written with modern Javascript which IE doesn't support 😢 so I rewrite it all in plain 'ol vanilla JS that should work across pretty much every browser out there 😎
2020-08-07T23:06:46Z	Really loving the fact I can edit my last Twt and correct typos or mis-mentions or other such mistakes 🤣
2020-08-08T01:25:27Z	@<gregorlove https://twtxt.net/user/gregorlove/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗
2020-08-08T02:15:09Z	@<gregorlove https://twtxt.net/user/gregorlove/twtxt.txt> (re IE1) Does it all work now?! 🤣
2020-08-08T05:14:39Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> I'm adding more feature to this very platform you are using 😎 You _may_ have noticed the new toolbar along the top now? As well as the "single-click" media/photo upload. The other buttons will work shortly too! 🤣
2020-08-08T05:15:10Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> Yeah you twt! 🤑
2020-08-08T05:15:41Z	@<swift_lang https://twtxt.net/user/swift_lang/twtxt.txt> Love the Avatar! Very nice! 😀
2020-08-08T07:14:15Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re fixing bugs for IE) Yes I am as we have users such as @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> that use Internet Explorer so it’s important that the web interface works for everybody! 👌
2020-08-08T07:36:12Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API time stamp issue) Thanks! I’ll have a look shortly and hopefully get it fixed ASAP!
2020-08-08T07:38:33Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re IOS App) Oooh very nice !!! 😁
2020-08-08T08:24:41Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Thanks@ We're trying to build an awesome social platform for all (_based around the simple ideas of [twtxt.txt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org)_) so we appreciate the kind words! 🤗 (cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<shahzeb https://twtxt.net/user/shahzeb/twtxt.txt>)
2020-08-08T09:04:14Z	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (re Mastodon cross-poster) Do you mind sharing the script/tool that you use to cross-post from Twtxt to Mastodon? It would really help us in terms of figuring out how much we ([twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)) should interoperate with Mastodon and vice versa.
2020-08-08T09:05:23Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> You _should_ know just as well as I do; if you just one one user reporting a bug or a problem; you _should_ (_at all reasonable effort_) go out of your way to help them, fix the problem, etc. No matter how we _all_ feel about IE over the years 🤣
2020-08-08T10:51:31Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Android App) Are you _thinking_ of building an Android App for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) ? 🤔
2020-08-08T11:08:15Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re IE) Let me be more clear... I choose to build this platform in certain ways that **ensure** that folks on old machines with old software, in areas of the world with poor Internet access/coverage can access a free, open an uncompressed "social network". @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> happens to be one such user that uses an older machine with Windows and IE. Why should I build a platform that isn't inclusive to as many folks as possible that is as performant and light on network as possible? I agree, there is a _balance_; but no one person should suffer just because... 🤔
2020-08-08T11:57:11Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Android App) Oh wonderful! You should probably join our development team then ! We've met twice on Hangouts so far to talk about the vision, plans and what we're up to. You and @antonion will get along nicely I think! 😎 I understand iOS/Android are two entirely different platforms but nevertheless ones we should target! What do you say? 😀
2020-08-08T12:55:54Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Android App) Yeah fair enough :D We are interesting fast! No time to waste! 🤣 Apparently [Gab](https://gab.com) (_which I think is a fork of Mastodon_) are building (_or have built?_) something similar; but as its a fork of Mastodon, its not even the same 🤣
2020-08-08T14:19:49Z	@<pbatch https://pbat.ch/twtxt.txt> (re Csound) wth?! wtf?! is "Csound"? 🤣
2020-08-08T14:20:51Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API time stamp issue) But it is fixed for you now right?! 🤣
2020-08-08T14:21:20Z	PS: I don't sleep sometimes 😳🤣
2020-08-08T14:32:22Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re API time stamp issue) Your welcome! 😎 Just a simple server mis-configuration!
2020-08-08T14:47:15Z	Was chatting with @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> last night (_its morning now! 🤣_) and we both agree that in terms of the single-pod Backend and Web App we're pretty much "feature complete" at this stage -- Bar of course the things we talked about yesterday re improving replies, permalinks, search. Anything beyond this I _believe_ will be focused on intra-pod features and hosted pod infra with 1-click hosted/managed pods.
2020-08-08T15:19:28Z	Just came across this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/TechTinkering/status/1291978927762743296?s=20) from [@TechTinkering[(https://twitter.com/TechTinkering) -- Glad you like [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) 😎 But you need to check out what we're doing here on https://twtxt.net/ 🤗
2020-08-08T15:36:07Z	Some _nice stats_ on the project so far: "Excluding merges, 9 authors have pushed 342 commits to master and 346 commits to all branches. On master, 0 files have changed and there have been 0 additions and 0 deletions." 😎
2020-08-08T15:41:28Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re TechTinkering liking twtxt) No that's true, he _may_ not... However I have _found_ out that what we've built is already pretty "discoverable" and the no. of random Twitter™ tweets I saw about `twtxt` were noticed here! So you see the power of "Google" (_search engines_) and the "Web" is pretty damn powerful! 🤣
2020-08-08T15:42:18Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re TechTinkering liking twtxt) But yes do make a "Tweet"™ or two 😀

2020-08-08T15:46:33Z	@<demetriusz https://twtxt.net/user/demetriusz/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Welcome (_belated sorry!_) to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 For some reason we missed that you joined and posted! Yes! "Golang is the best!" Rock on Gopher!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/3pLwBskwgX5cyvfRQXsQoY.png)
2020-08-08T15:48:46Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (maybe my last tweet) Haha 🤣 Very nice! Very eloquently put! 😎
2020-08-08T21:37:09Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re IDEs); I use _only_ `Vim`. I also use a suite of UNIX tools. One such tool I frequently use to search against codebases is called [Sift](https://github.com/svent/sift).
2020-08-08T21:40:07Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> (re Settings quirk); Can you tell me specifically which version of IE you are using? I don't see this particular UI quirk in my test IE VM...  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/hvVJUKyHCewmvMa2Eh5Vji.png)
2020-08-08T21:42:05Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> (re punctuation) Ya know... You can "Edit" your last Twt 😛
2020-08-08T21:43:01Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> (re www.) Yeah `www` as a sub-domain is a pretty old idea these days and almost nobody does it. In fact here on [www.twtxt.net](https://www.twtxt.net) it just redirects to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net). Make sense? 😎
2020-08-08T22:07:39Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Settings quirk) Oh! I can't even find the stupid "version" page thingie on my test VM 🤣 That would be much appreciated @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> ! Thank you 🙇‍♂️

Does this imply a rather large global egress drop from China? 🤔

2020-08-09T08:54:07Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> Nice avatar :) I manually nuked the old cached entry :)
2020-08-09T08:57:34Z	🥱 caching is hard 🧐
2020-08-09T09:13:41Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> Oh so force-refreshing your browser fied the `/settings` page for you? Awesome :)
2020-08-09T09:15:27Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> Does the new shiny formatting toolbar abovee the text box also work for you nicely? 😀
2020-08-09T14:00:43Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re cutting grass) We got rid of all our grass ! 🤣 No more mower for a while till we get the place returfed 😎 I'll send a pretty pic in the morning 🥱 (_midnight here, woke up in a cold sweater 🥵_)
2020-08-09T14:15:49Z	@<shahzeb https://twtxt.net/user/shahzeb/twtxt.txt> (re hard work) Oooh very nicely put! Perhaps consider creating a feed of stuff like this? Maybe "daily_wisdom"? 🤔 I love it! 😍
2020-08-09T14:17:22Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> Haven't seen a peep out of you the last few days... Are you okay? What's up? 👋
2020-08-09T16:36:00Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re IE quirk) Mind fixing them? 😀
2020-08-09T17:27:56Z	First Twt from CLI client
2020-08-09T20:33:32Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re water) Yeah that's about right! 💧Its around ~150kL/yr of water for an average household around Australia/Brisbane and ~350kL if you're a larger household with say a pool, etc. So I'd even postulate that you can do quite a lot with just 0.5ML/yr 😀
2020-08-09T20:35:13Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Twtxt.net API client) Ooh very nice! What is this written in? Which lib/framework?

2020-08-10T07:30:49Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Speaking of which... Would you be interested in taking your `tw` codebase and perhaps @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt>'s [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) and contributing to this project's CLI client? I put together the basic skeleton last night and it is able to auth, get a token and post. Wanna help? 😀
2020-08-10T07:52:39Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt cli) It is _meant_ to be a UNIX (_be all design principles_) command-line client to _any_ [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) pod, like this one. I _would_ expect it to behave like a nice UNIX tool and have some nice features 😎 Technically it would just speak to the [API](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/api.html) ... Still interested? 🤗

Today marks the day [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) has its first native #<iOS https://twtxt.net/search?tag=iOS> App! 🎉 Thanks to @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> for all the hard work he's put into this so far! Its amazing how far we've come in just ~3 weeks! Congrats to all new users that have joined the growing twtxt community and to all the devs here building this for you! 😎
2020-08-10T21:46:22Z	With some _recent_ fixes for the Web App, [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) now has a 92% score in [Google Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) 🤗  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/y4RMrNpT3EL2u92SjzsYY9.png)
2020-08-10T21:58:26Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re first app) I hope so too! 🤗
2020-08-10T22:00:08Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re UI updates) Glad you like it! We have _even more_ UI/UX updates coming soon™ 🤣
2020-08-10T22:00:59Z	Also... Check out my feed on Astrophotography 🌑 📷 ==> @<astrophotography https://twtxt.net/user/astrophotography/twtxt.txt>
2020-08-10T23:15:23Z	This is great !!! Now I can read my Twts and post new ones like this one whilst on the 🚽 doing a 💩 🤣 from the #<iOS https://twtxt.net/search?tag=iOS> App 😂 Too much information?! 🤔
2020-08-10T23:17:02Z	Really need that Markdown rendering 😁 #<iOS https://twtxt.net/search?tag=iOS> #<App https://twtxt.net/search?tag=App>
2020-08-10T23:24:34Z	💁‍♂️ But seriously though... The reason I love and am so passionate about what we've built here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is because I now get to participate in "social media" without having to hand over any Personal Identifiable Information ([PIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)), clicks, who I follow, who follows me, behaviour, etc. This is part of the reason I built this in the first place! 🤗 #<twtxt https://twtxt.net/search?tag=twtxt>
2020-08-10T23:25:31Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re different Emoji) Likely because of different system fonts between devices. But I _think_ that's okay?
2020-08-11T01:03:27Z	☺️Weird on my macOS Desktop it renders that _one_ Emoji differently too 🤔
2020-08-11T01:04:17Z	But its rendered that way as I type it! Like ☺️which is the only once that behaves that way? macOS bug? 🤷‍♂️

2020-08-11T05:15:20Z	Just saw this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106) from @<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> himself? (_bit dated though `12:13 AM · Dec 12, 2019`_) « Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. » Is this for real? Fund [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😀

2020-08-11T13:54:31Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re HR recruitment industry) Yeah I can sympathise with that.  😢 Makes one feel like a _cheap_ contractor sometimes, I've found over the years (_even worse_) is you don't even get a "look in" if you don't keep your CV / Résumé up-to-date with all the latest "buzzwords" and "marketing hype". I wish I was joking. 😱
2020-08-11T20:22:59Z	Good Morning Twters 🤗 🥱

But why do we need to "track" users and their behaviour in the first place? 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-12T00:21:38Z	💡 In other news... I'm _thinking_ 🤔 about how we will build out so-called "Federation" features between [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) pods, and ultimately a network of them. My current set of ideas is to build notifications of "User A on Pod X mentioned User B on Pod Y" and "User A on Pod X started following User B on Pod Y" as [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) feeds themselves that are "polled" periodically. This has the benefit of allowing _anyone_ or _anything_ to also implement the same features, but the downside of not being "real-time". Thoughts? 👈
2020-08-12T00:45:30Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> (re bed rest) What about [Plex.tv](https://www.plex.tv/en-au/) 😀

2020-08-12T02:14:30Z	Beat local Café — Cafe Bliss, Kenmore Village  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Mgwxgx3hyM4chUWXWM8YGm.png)
2020-08-12T03:45:19Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Federation) I _think_... There are two choices here; a) We do some kind of [WebMention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) "think" (_haven't looked into this too closely yet..._) b) Some kind of "Web Hook" pushes to other pods or c) A "poll" based approach that is basically just a special type of feed between pods. I kind of personally like the simplicity of the later (c) as it means anyone can just periodically check for new followers by just say `curl`(ing) the feed. OTOH it _might_ be better to do some WebMention/WebHook thing in a simple way?
2020-08-12T03:45:44Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> (re bed rest) You're welcome!
2020-08-12T03:47:10Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Which one? The local café or the petrol station?! 🤣
2020-08-12T03:54:48Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> I see on your last Twt you had actually _edited_ it. I _know_ this because it was in position X in my timeline, then when I got back home from the shops it was in position Y above my reply to you 🤣 Interesting side-effect of "Editing" your last Twt 🤔 We really should get [this issue](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/89) done soon to limit the impact of this behaviour that _could_ throw users off if they are unaware! 😂
2020-08-12T05:31:52Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (tiktok tracking) You do realize I was being facetious right? 😋 I _know_ very well why large tech companies do this, especially on large social media platforms like [Facebook](https://twtxt.net/#)™, [Twitter](https://twtxt.net/#)™, [TikTok](https://twtxt.net/#)™, etc 🙃

2020-08-12T10:46:57Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (last paragraph re mozilla layoff) can you quote it here? :)
2020-08-12T20:59:55Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> But I'm too lazy 😛 What's the point of a Twtxt platform if I can't read about something here 🤣
2020-08-12T21:02:10Z	@<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> (re using twtxt.net without an account) No that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. How would it know how to identify you so you can "manipulate" your feed? Is there an issue with having to have an account? Do you want support for say OAuth/OpenID or IndieAuth or something?
2020-08-12T21:13:51Z	Yes the Mozilla thing is a bit of a worry. I worry about the Open Web too; but from a "technical" perspective I _believe_ it can never be destroyed. Fundamentally I'm not convinced you can really centralise or control something that isn't really a tangible thing, "Internet". But I would support Mozilla too; just like I support Wikipedia every year.
2020-08-12T21:17:42Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Twt edits) Yes. This is one reason why the Web Interface doesn't behave like this, it just shows the last N twts and allows you to pages through them. Perhaps the Mobile App can do this too? As you scroll down past the last item it'll just add a `?p=N` to the API call?
2020-08-12T22:26:19Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Twt edits) Yeah I get that. So _thinking_ here based on my experience adding new features to and fixing bugs for @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt>'s [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) a while back; If you build a cache client-side (_look at the implementation on twtxt.net for how this is done, maybe I should document it at https://dev.twtxt.net ?_); if you sent me the `CacheLastModified` timestamp we could compare that with the backend API's `CacheLastModified` timestamp too right?

2020-08-13T03:57:59Z	@<tim https://twtxt.net/user/tim/twtxt.txt> Hello! 👋  Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 -- To answer your question, you _would_ have to read my [Blog Posts](https://prologic.blog) on this! 😀 -- However the short of it that [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and _thus_ the software/platform behind it actually uses the _very same_ [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec. Almost nothing there has changed. Think of this as a convenient frontend! 😎 Now.. That being said we _will_ also very soon be offering a fully hosted managed 1-click offering where anyone can spin up their own version of this! 🎉
2020-08-13T03:59:20Z	@<tim https://twtxt.net/user/tim/twtxt.txt> (re love the UI) Thanks! We're thrilled you like it so far! (_we have updates coming/planned for even better experience!_) -- Re your Avatar; its just a "cache" problem we've struggled to solve; but I do see it at least already! 🤷‍♂️ Maybe your particular browser is being silly? 🤣

2020-08-13T06:18:14Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> Like I said... If Mozilla started asking for donations from the general public whether or not they actually use any of my Mozilla’s products, I would totally support them and donate every single year just like I do for the Wikipedia foundation! We all need to collectively continue to support open standards and an open Web! 💚 #<openweb https://twtxt.net/search?tag=openweb>

2020-08-13T21:58:08Z	@<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> Argg that's so frustrating. I'm running IE 11+ in a VM and cannot reproduce what you're seeing :/ I'll call you later and we'll try to fix this ok! 😀 So sorry 😢
2020-08-14T08:18:31Z	@felixp7 Hey! 👋 Welcome! I noticed you joined our little pod here, but now I can't see your profile anymore 😢 Your feed is still there (_we don't delete feeds_); Did you perhaps accidentally (_or otherwise_) delete your account? Did you change usernames or something? LMK :) Hope you see this! 🤗
2020-08-14T08:22:10Z	@<tknz https://twtxt.net/user/tknz/twtxt.txt> @<iggi https://twtxt.net/user/iggi/twtxt.txt> Hey there! 👋 Thanks for all the help s far! 😍 If you'd like to participate in our very early "alpha" hosted pods, just shoot me an email at `prologic at shortcircuit dot net dot au` and we'll get you in! Just give me till at least the end of this weekend to get everything all nicely polishes and proper! We only just finished building this feature just today! 🎉 (cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt>)
2020-08-14T08:28:04Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> Oh dear; You _might_ have found an unexpected bug. that's okay! We'll squish it! 🐛  Since I'm the pod operator of this particular pod, let me go rename your `felixp7` feed temporarily and let you re-create your account. Make a twt and MLK when you're done and I'll merge the `twtxt.txt` file back? Sorry about this! 😢
2020-08-14T08:30:01Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> Also one of the things we plan on doing with the "Hosted Pods" offering is allowing users to move around pods if they wish. So you can basically take your feed and all your data with you. We're still working on all this, and I just finished building the 1-click Hosted Pods feature today!
2020-08-14T08:43:39Z	@<Felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> Fortunately this isn't a bug. I just discovered the backend had OOMed (_Out of Memory_) a few times. I will probably spend tonight (_late my time, AEST_) redoing the infra a bit ti improve this. Again sorry! Meanwhile I've bumped up the memory of the backing VMs and increased the quote/limit of the service a bit.
2020-08-14T11:05:45Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> Welcome back! Sorry about the experience! I'm working on it! The pod was under resource pressure and git killed a few times. I've since mitigated that. As for your "account data" I won't easily be able to recover that; however I _noticed_ you were using `txtnish` client. You _should_ be able to "import" your following list from that client into here by following [/import[(https://twtxt.net/import). LMK if I can help further!
2020-08-14T11:07:19Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Avatar) yeah caching is quite hard to get right and somehow we still haven't really solved that I guess even though we've attempted to do so multiple times now :/ It _does_ work but either the client's browser caches the auto-generated avatar (_identicon_) or cloudflare is being silly or both? Not sure we'll keep improving things! 😀
2020-08-14T13:49:07Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re-following you) Don't worry, just keeping twt'ing 🤣 We're actually getting pretty good with per-pod discovery already and we will soon also make intra-pod discovery work nicely too! 🤗
2020-08-14T13:50:16Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt>(re plain-text file) To be fair, this platform __is__ backed by plain text files 🤣 I can recover the first first twts you posted if you want them merged back in? :)
2020-08-14T14:27:06Z	📣 **ANN:** Introducing the first _alpha_ version of fully managed, 1-click hosted pods [twt.social](https://twt.social); of the same software that backs [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🎉 This means you can now request a pod of your own and get your own `yourname.twt.social` for yourself, your family or community. Please get in touch if you'd like to have one today! __Please Note:__ This is very early alpha and we invite all alpha testers to join! 🤗 Check it out! https://twt.social/

2020-08-15T00:54:38Z	@<shahzeb https://twtxt.net/user/shahzeb/twtxt.txt> (re #<iOS https://twtxt.net/search?tag=iOS> App) Thanks! It’s all @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> 🤗
2020-08-15T02:30:03Z	@<hellson https://twtxt.net/user/hellson/twtxt.txt> Got any pics to share? 📷
2020-08-15T04:44:12Z	It’s been threatening to storm here for a while...  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Uh4i7dtt93bF47C9RMBy5.png) 🌩📷
2020-08-15T05:15:30Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re PHP) Yea my too!  I actually wrote a Wiki Engine around the same time MoinMoin was being developed. I called mine `PWiki` then later it become `PWiki2` 🤣 Such a loooong time ago!
2020-08-15T07:22:02Z	![](https://twtxt.net/media/Z3LPtyYC8TtXk2jBqSTFH5.png) Soms time ago I hand built this Bird house 😁📷🦜
2020-08-15T07:57:36Z	Can anyone help with [this bug](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/109) 🐛 I don't get it 🤷‍♂️ #<web https://twtxt.net/search?tag=web> #<twtxt https://twtxt.net/search?tag=twtxt>
2020-08-15T08:07:20Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Hahaha coincidentally; have a read of [this](https://twtxt.net/twt/hvbqdrrz6sll7uoqbxoozkshzuacgm33i7xffshkkpm7njtelozq) 🤣
2020-08-15T09:08:36Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Which bug? Link to the twt?
2020-08-15T09:09:40Z	@<local_wonders https://twtxt.net/user/local_wonders/twtxt.txt> (re 🌈) Very nice! 🤗
2020-08-15T12:32:51Z	@<buckket https://buckket.org/twtxt.txt> 👋 I owe you a **sincere** apology! When I came across your _really_ cool and simple [twtxt.txt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec, I fell in love. Then I built what you see here today (_~5wks in the making now..._). Apparently I said "I was the new @bucket"" (_and because I'm actually legally blind I probably even typo'd the handle!_). I should not have done this; and I'm clearly not you, and I'm sorry for making this "joke". After talking to @erlehmann a fair bit tonight I _believe_ we actually have similar ideas and ideals and I'd love to connect with you.
2020-08-15T22:02:13Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> This is really awesome stuff you’ve shared on off grid living! Can’t wait to see the next series of posts from you! 🤗
2020-08-15T23:29:36Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> Why do Twts like [this one](https://twtxt.net/twt/id3vib6djing6vj45dalsj7qpzvrpp4uwwmt2emnt3ik5nwrspca) not render the #<hashtag https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hashtag> ? 🤔
2020-08-16T00:37:02Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re hashtag not rendering) Yeah I suspected as much and there’s already half the  code to handle this so it shouldn’t be too difficult I think?
2020-08-16T05:16:57Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> @<rell https://twtxt.net/user/rell/twtxt.txt> @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Hello 👋 Just one more user and this pod will have a nice round 100! 💯 🤣
2020-08-16T06:21:12Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> eh? What was the time out issue?
2020-08-16T06:51:58Z	@<becrobinson86 https://twtxt.net/user/becrobinson86/twtxt.txt> Hahaha that sounds awesome! (_except for the roast part!_); I _think_ we're having the same thing (_except veggie roast!_) 😉
2020-08-16T06:52:55Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> Hmmmm 🤔 can't honestly say I've seen it. Will have to add it to my Plex archive 😀
2020-08-16T06:54:04Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re Pull Refresh); What for the Web App or the #<iOS https://twtxt.net/search?tag=iOS> App? The iOS App has this already AFAIK; right @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> ? (cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt>)
2020-08-16T06:55:44Z	Speaking of enhancements to the Web App (_at least_); it _might_ be nice to have it automatically initiate a WebSockets connection to the backend or have a WebWorker background task that periodically polls the API and when there are new items in your "Timeline' in the feed cache to display a banner along the top saying so with a button to pull those in... 🤔
2020-08-16T08:46:52Z	🎉 **NEW:** As of `v0.0.12-71-g79202a2` of [prologic/twtxt](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt) _all_ [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods such as this one ([twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)) now display the date/time of posts in the timezone of your choice. Go to your [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) to change your timezone from the default of `UTC` to your local timezone, e.g: `Australia/Brisbane` 🤗
2020-08-16T10:31:29Z	@<melyanna http://tilde.club/~melyanna/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> I'm kind of curious about something... You both seem to post every 30-60s when you do. As if your client restricts you to a mere ~100-144 characters? 🤣 Its merely just an observation... No big deal, just wondering why 🤔
2020-08-16T10:51:47Z	[/.](https://slashdot.org) is _really_ pushing this Firefox issue! This has to be the 5th or 6th time I've seen a story on it? 🤔
2020-08-17T03:04:43Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (working on weekend) Not sure why but...  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/McdYth66TXohfhZVFioGRE.png)
2020-08-17T03:05:44Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re macOS Keyboard Shortcuts) you can even type Emojis too! Like this one 🤣 `Control + Command + Space` 😎
2020-08-17T03:27:57Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (working on weekend) Yeah I'm not sure why I can't view some Youtube videos really. Really kind of odd.
2020-08-17T14:16:27Z	@<cosmix https://twtxt.net/user/cosmix/twtxt.txt> (re relative time) Yeah I was using [humaize.Time](github.com/dustin/go-humanize) and _for some_ reason decided to try [sprig's ago](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/date.html) instead; which I _think_ kind of sucks. I _might_ switch back; but I'll have a look to see if `day.js` can "enhance" the UX for sure! 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-17T14:20:29Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> Interesting you should say this... I'm also on [Micro.blog](https://prologic.blog) _as you know..._ I also find it a bit "tiresome" somewhat. Not really sure what it is to be honest; but your twt made me think about this; "How do you continue to evolve an interesting and vibrant community with meaningful discourse?" 🤔 Then again we now have [Twt.social](https://twt.social/signup) pods where folks _can_ create their own "communities" 😎
2020-08-17T14:50:00Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re timeout) Hmm sorry about this. I'll look into this on my end a bit...
2020-08-17T14:51:08Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re keyboard shortcuts) Same way? 🤣
2020-08-17T16:53:16Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re creative prompts) I'm always open to ideas! So if you have any "feature" ideas or "community" efforts (cc @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt>) please let us know 😀
2020-08-17T16:56:21Z	I love CI/CD pipelines when they work perfectly! 😍 Right on queue `twtxt v0.0.12@ab978b3`
2020-08-17T18:20:12Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> @<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Which jack btw? :)
2020-08-17T18:22:00Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re tent peg) Looks fine  😎 📷
2020-08-17T18:23:09Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Oh 😲 You use @<netdata https://twtxt.net/user/netdata/twtxt.txt> ? That's where I work! 🤣
2020-08-17T18:42:57Z	Just got [WebMentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) working finally. Not yet merged to `master` or deployed to prod. I'd love it if _anyone_ could help me test this before doing so! Just jump on to either https://twtxt-webmentions1.mills.io/ or https://twtxt-webmentions2.mills.io/ (_or both_). You  can see a sample of it working [here](https://twtxt-webmentions1.mills.io/twt/7nd5mhsavefcyoahe3rc4zohe5t6td6kzcvw6q7zvluhmwufhgeq) and [here](https://twtxt-webmentions2.mills.io/twt/vbunqhoj2pj76rkzqwfmsbhrw3nks3dhtn4tiyjkhwmavv6fpr4a) Thanks! 😎
2020-08-17T18:56:40Z	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> I _do_ believe I follow @<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> too 👋 Jack!

2020-08-18T00:07:50Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> OMG! 😱 Who's out 100th user on [this pod](https://twtxt.net)⁉️ 😲 C'mon speak up! 😀 Tell us who you are or say hi at least! This is very exciting!!! 🎉
2020-08-18T03:51:00Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re website) congrats ! 🎉 I shall check it out 😎
2020-08-18T03:52:03Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> Hahahaha 🤣😂 Getting a bit ahead of ourselves there aren't we? 🤪
2020-08-18T03:53:19Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re cross-posting to micro.blog) Oh that's right! You just include it as another "blog source" in your [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) account right and it automatically pulls it in?
2020-08-18T06:04:32Z	🎉 **ANN:** [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_and all [twt.social](https://twt.social) pods_) now support [WebMentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) 🎉 I'll write a larger blog post about this later, but for the non-technical folks here, this means you can now mention/tag someone on another pod. There's much to be improved on the "User Experience" of discovering other pods and users on them, but we're working on it™ ! Happy twt'ing! 🤗
2020-08-18T06:05:48Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> My favourite is actually [PlexAmp](https://plexamp.com/) connected to my [Plex](https://plex.tv) server 🤣 Its all very wonderful 😎
2020-08-18T06:07:05Z	Testing testing 1 2 3... Hello @<james https://4069.twt.social/user/james/twtxt.txt> from the [4069 pod](https://4069.twt.social) 👋
2020-08-18T06:25:05Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Webmentions) Thanks! 😎 I think it’ll be a nice interop feature!
2020-08-18T06:32:38Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re cross-posting to micro.blog) Hmmm I added my Atom twtxt.net feed but I don’t see anything? 🤔
2020-08-18T06:39:40Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re cross-posting to micro.blog) Oh? How are dimensions broken?
2020-08-18T07:43:42Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re cross-posting to micro.blog) Ahhh because [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) doesn't know how to render twtxt URI(s). Hmmm 🤔 But I _think_ we can solve this be pre-processing the twts before we shove them into the Atom feed. Wanna file a bug?
2020-08-18T07:56:53Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re cross-posting to micro.blog) Never-mind filing a bug, I fixed it :)
2020-08-18T20:56:00Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re browser scope creep) Yeah I tend to agree _somewhat_, over the years I've found Web Browsers become far too complex, resource hungry, unnecessary features and many of them (_at least the open source ones_), countless millions of lines of code! I'm sure @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> has something to say about Web Browsers too 😀
2020-08-18T20:58:24Z	@<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> « You’ll Need a Facebook Account To Use Future Oculus Headsets ⌘ http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/SOIhVBD7SS4/youll-need-a-facebook-account-to-use-future-oculus-headsets » < But of course, why just stop at creating an awesome piece of hardware? 😢
2020-08-18T21:56:01Z	👋 Hiya all! What new features, fixes or enhancements would you ike to see on [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods such as [this one](https://twtxt.net)? Let us know by replying or contact me directly via the [/support](https://twtxt.net/support) page! Thanks! 😎
2020-08-18T22:54:21Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re RSS reader) Hahah 🤣 I _first_ started out with that kind of thinking, only to realise that actually writing a good RSS Reader I would actually use daily was well _all too hard_™ So I built this instead (twtxt.net) 😂 Now I have the best of both worlds, social media + news feeds 😎
2020-08-18T23:54:57Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re RSS Reader) You _could_  try [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) as your RSS/News  reader? If you like I can send you an invite code for your own private pod where you can try this out. You can pull in all kinda of RSS feeds from [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) (_which are available on every pod under /feeds_)
2020-08-18T23:56:07Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> For example (_this screenshot_):  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/umo37KEZp2pj6G5cBQDGEG.png)
2020-08-19T00:03:29Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Yeah I really love Go too! ![](https://blog.golang.org/go-brand/logos.jpg)
2020-08-19T00:14:47Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (rss) FraidyCat looks interesting. Glad to see more efforts like this! 👍

2020-08-19T01:37:27Z	![](https://twtxt.net/media/5a6XqJDxQgfw4xvrxZA2fC.png) Not sure you’ll ever see a seagull ever this close!
2020-08-19T01:38:27Z	![](https://twtxt.net/media/UNuDc8pYvSahiyTkXUmAZK.png) No comment! 😎📷
2020-08-19T03:31:37Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re podcasts) Can't way I ever got into them at all really (_no matter what the topic_) 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-19T05:50:09Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (Re #<Google https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Google> #<Mozilla https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Mozilla> deal) oh that’s a very interesting thought! You might be onto something there… 😁
2020-08-19T08:05:03Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (ranch) 🤣 Can you believe its actually a ranch in California? 😂
2020-08-19T11:29:27Z	Hello @<TaMeR https://4069.twt.social/user/tamer> 👋 Welcome to the twtxt community! 😎
2020-08-19T11:50:38Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re CSS PR) Please by all means! All PRs welcome to make this platform better! 😎
2020-08-19T11:59:14Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> (re Bus etiquette) Having a bad day eh? 😀 I'd often wondered myself what its like to catch a bus, I haven't caught a bus in almost a year now :/
2020-08-19T12:59:10Z	@<melyanna http://tilde.club/~melyanna/twtxt.txt> (re IndieWeb compat) If you come up with a list of things to add/address/etc let us know!

2020-08-19T21:45:28Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> How is VBA even a language?! 😱
2020-08-19T21:58:34Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re Solar DC Power) That's really awesome stuff! (_sorry about the poor photos, we can improve those later if you have higher res ones?_) -- So $440 AUD/yr in maintenance costs is still pretty good really considering you ran your entire house off this! 👍 I'd be very interested in seeing on your next install whether these [BYD B-Plus Lithium Battery - 2.56kWh - 48V](https://www.rpc.com.au/catalog/byd-b-plus-lithium-battery-2560wh-48v-p-4645.html) will do better and be even more cost effective in the long run since they have a 10yr warranty. 🤔
2020-08-19T22:04:18Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re Solar + Wind) I _think_ (_no proof_) the idea behind this is that you are in fact drawing power from Solar during the day and Wind at night and _often_ (_if you size up your system right_) **NOT** from your battery bank(s); whih are there only as a backup and for higher loads. If you have a system with 2 sources of power generation 24/7 you might not ever even need a battery bank at all; maybe spin up a flywheel instead 😀 (_as storage_), or just have a backup ATS switch to a genset in case of power loss?  🤔
2020-08-19T22:53:18Z	😲 Today at my day-job (@<netdata https://twtxt.net/user/netdata/twtxt.txt>) I got through all my Github Notifications, Emails and Slack messages in ~20mins! 😳 Today is going to be a _productive_ day me thinks 🤣
2020-08-19T22:54:10Z	Time to make a 3rd cup of ☕️ 😎
2020-08-19T23:19:59Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re coding buddy) How often does he talk back⁉️ 🤣
2020-08-19T23:37:20Z	🎉 **NEW:** Just _rolled_ a fix for media upload handling which will correctly automatically orient images according to their EXIF orientation tags (_Thanks to this [library](https://github.com/disintegration/imageorient)_) 🎉 📷 -- No more upside images! 😎
2020-08-19T23:46:53Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> let’s try that upside down ranch again and see if it correctly orientates itself!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/pvqg3RhqqyLpwEZvf4LHaP.png)
2020-08-20T00:03:55Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> 😲 We have 3 new folks here on this [pod](https://twtxt.net) 🎉 Hi y'all! I know one of them is @<joe https://twtxt.net/user/joe/twtxt.txt> Welcome! 👋
2020-08-20T00:06:52Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re 3rd ☕️) Tea just doesn't cut it for me! I'd never get anything done! The condition that makes me blind 👨‍🦯 takes it out of me a bit and I am therefore a) not a morning person and b) have little energy most of the time (_internally_). So 3 strong cups of coffee per day for me it i! 🤣
2020-08-20T00:34:10Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re 3rd ☕️) I drink those expresso pod 'thingies" (_of course the biodegradeable, compostable capsules!_); And I have no sugar and only Soy Milk 😎
2020-08-20T00:35:40Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (image orientation) Yes! Also _really_ smart folks out there that do amazing things! 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-20T00:37:12Z	@<annekemp https://twtxt.net/user/annekemp/twtxt.txt> Please some some photos 📷 of these wonderful little critters! 🐟 Also I _think_ you should [create a new feed](https://twtxt.net/feeds) specifically for your "Lungfish" research, findings and discussions :)
2020-08-20T00:37:59Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re search/replace) That's what `sed` is for 🤣
2020-08-20T01:04:34Z	OMG! 😱 [AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com)' website _really sucks_. How do you build such complex monstrosities of a website that is just hard to use and inaccessible? I'm _trying_ to login to my AWS account (_root account_) so I can go spin up some EC2 instances for work (@<netdata https://twtxt.net/user/netdata/twtxt.txt>) for an issue I'm working on and I can't login, It insists I have to create a new account, when I do it claims the email address is already in use! D'uh I have an account damnit! So let's contact support, fill in the form, hit Submit, **BOOM** a random page, message => `/dev/null` 🤬
2020-08-20T01:22:53Z	Oh good! I take it back! A very lovely person by the name of "Khalif, Liban" phoned me personally! So it would appear the messages I _tried_ to send did not in fact go to `/dev/null` 🤣 Thank you Khalif, Liban! 🤗 Amazing what "good customer service" can do! Please make it easier to contact a human next time and fix that page 😀
2020-08-20T01:34:41Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re amazon) Oh! Is that how [Incident Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management) and [Customer Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service) work⁉️ 🤣 (_believe me there are soo many companies that fail at both!_)
2020-08-20T01:37:35Z	😲 Guess what?! [This pod]((https://twtxt.net) has reached 1,000,000 hits this month (_and the month isn't even over yet!_) 🎉 😱 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/TfZnJcTH554wRnpEQrMDNh.png)  It's all thanks to you awesome people that have joined us here and believe in what we're building! 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-20T01:45:06Z	Oh actually @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> / @antoinio the RSS syndication into your [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) account _actually_ works really well after a few minor fixes I made to the `SyndicationHandler()` -- See:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/osnWLUDi4R3p2DKHY2aciY.png) Now I get to have "conversations" in two places! 🤣
2020-08-20T03:42:21Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Flutter App) Oh my! 😲 Please share! When/Where will you publish this? Where are we going with this? Tell us more! 😎
2020-08-20T03:43:35Z	Hello @<oxplot https://twtxt.net/user/oxplot/twtxt.txt> 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 So glad you can join our little community here and this pod! 🙌
2020-08-20T05:25:00Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Flutter App) 😲 That looks really amazing! Given that its Flutter though, this is not just for Android right? Desktop too?
2020-08-20T05:28:13Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re simple single-page websites) Here here! I'm hearing ya and @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> would agree! That's why I built this [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) with deliberation and careful choice of tools and libraries. I (_for example_) opted __NOT__ to use Bootstrap, or jQuery or any other "heavyweight" "things". I hope you find the experience "acceptable" 🤣 Good read btw!

2020-08-20T11:27:30Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> (re automated Dilbert feed) Use the API and/or the CLI? Although now that I mention this I _should_ bring the API up to parity (_as well as the CLI_) with the Web App -- Specifically the API is missing the ability to "postas" I believe.
2020-08-20T11:28:03Z	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> Hello Jack! 👋 Welcome back! Yes your test was successful 😎
2020-08-20T11:29:01Z	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> Feel free to move your feed to [twxt.net](https://twtxt.net) or create your own Pod if you want over at [Twt.social](https://twt.social) 😀
2020-08-20T11:30:02Z	@<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> (re 5G testing) Hahahahaha 🤣😂 Love it! Sadly _might_ be some element of truth to this too 🤷‍♂️

2020-08-20T12:28:58Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> (re automated Dilbert feed) Good! Learn Go! Trust me it'll take you but a few hours! Its a really simple yet powerful language! And don't worry, give your background and experience I'm sure you'll pick it up quickly and rip my code apart! 🤣 My biggest problem is finding a good set of interfaces/abstractions to reduce the amount of copy/pasted code between the Web handlers and API handlers.
2020-08-20T13:22:25Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re Podcast and Cults) According to Wikipedia: > In modern English, a cult is a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or by its common interest in a particular ... 🤷‍♂️ So I dunno 🤣

2020-08-20T15:18:43Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Sorry my mistake, you _can_ `postas` via the API 😎
2020-08-20T15:41:00Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Flutter App functionality) I have no opinion either way either, as I can already see "alternative" web apps / interfaces being built too (_perhaps not be me, but nevetheless_). I _think_ our main goals should be to get a solid API going, Pod management and a decent working Android/iOS app of some kind!
2020-08-20T20:58:29Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re Flutter App functionality) Calling it X for Twt.social is a good call. I like it 😀 I also agree with @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> that calling any particular version of a mobile app "official" is a bit pointless, we should document the protocol, the spec (_done_), but I see no reason why there aren't be more than one "web app" (_perhaps bundled with the software and user-chosen which ones is used_), etc.
2020-08-20T23:22:30Z	@<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> (re taking control of your family's digital assets); You _should_ read my @<home_datacenter https://twtxt.net/user/home_datacenter/twtxt.txt> feed on this! I will be talking about how I do this as soon as I'm done talking about my "Home Datacenter" setup 😀 TL;DR [Plex](https://plex.tv) + [Self-hosted App](https://gist.github.com/prologic/c165403fb6ac07c16dc9fd6eeb8efbd2) + a few other bits/pieces...
2020-08-20T23:43:33Z	Ahh I love it when performance is measured, analysed then fixed! See these before and after shots! You can clearly see what the p95/p99 performance was overall before I attempted to fix it, which failed, then realised what I'd done wrong and fixed it proper in the very clear drops in p95. The p99 spikes to ~4s I suspect are coming from the `postHandler()` and the new webmentions feature.   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/YSv9FALh5CKcvL5JkJPKb.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/VpHpfVcCRotzwuebN3475R.png)

Fear not, just re-upload a new one! The reason for this is uploaded media/avatars are now even better and faster, but it makes no sense to fix the old avatars/media content. 🙇‍♂️

2020-08-25T12:51:58Z	@<nristen https://karl.theharrisclan.net/twtxt.txt> Welcome back to the wonderful world of Twtxt 😎 Glad to see you back after a year of hiatus 😀
2020-08-25T13:05:39Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Oh noes! 😢 You need to re-upload @<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt>'s avatar 😀 See [my FYI](https://twtxt.net/twt/a36a7br5mxq)
2020-08-25T13:07:15Z	@<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> (re Ted Takes Selfie With Bear) Oh ahahahahahaha 🤣 Very good! Dilbert you always crack me up! 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-25T13:10:00Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Thank you :D
2020-08-25T13:10:36Z	I _think_ the WebP "looks better" IHMO 😎
2020-08-25T13:11:21Z	Its too bad we can't just embed the Dilbert comic strip itself in each new Twt 😀
2020-08-25T13:12:11Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> It was for a _very_ good reason I swear! 🤣
2020-08-25T13:21:47Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (Dilbert) What about we ask the author for permission "politely"? 😀
2020-08-25T13:23:20Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re Avatar caching) Yes we _fixed_ that good and proper finally! Just too me having to read some docs on how caching works again 🤣 Also much thanks to @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> for doing a lot of the caching leg-work early on! 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-25T13:51:59Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (Dilbert) I'm kind of curious what they'd charge 🤔
2020-08-25T14:23:51Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (Dilbert) Judging b _those_ license fees its pretty hefty pricing structure. Oh well :) And no I don't want to venture down the "dark side" either. We'll just link to 'em externally! It's still a lot of fun! 😀 We can have the "discussions" in-reply-to @<dilbert https://twtxt.net/user/dilbert/twtxt.txt> here 😎
2020-08-25T21:08:21Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re twtxt front matter) if by "Front Matter"  you means `// key = value` comments at the top of you your filek, then no it won't. Most (_if not alll?_) clients will simply ignore this, including [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) -- The real question is whether we can build up the community enough to a point where we can reach consensus on a standardized scheme for this so-called key/value pair(s) we call commented out "front-matter"
2020-08-25T21:11:05Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Also nice Avatar... Have you always had that at the root of your twtxt feed or did you add it since you started noticing [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) now looks for avatars for externals feeds? 🤔  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gkmxbMPTyxyjZbGGr5ZXUi) 📷
2020-08-25T21:11:34Z	Good Morning Twters ☕️
2020-08-25T21:18:40Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re avatar.png) very nice! Thanks for following suit. We will document all of the little additional things that we are making to make Twtxt better 😎
2020-08-25T21:42:44Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re Twtxt medium) Yeah that's just the thing, I love that too! But of course there's no reason a "smart" client can't interpret the text as "Markdown" for example, which we do on twtxt.net and all Twt.social pods; and things like a standard Avatar and standard Config just make things a whole lot nicer. I'll talk about the standard Config next when I've had a chance to review what we've done there with @<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> 😀 In the past we'd just use those key/value pairs as comments at the top of your feed, but tbh that was never standardized and is kind of hard to...
2020-08-25T21:44:21Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re Twtxt Config) ...deal with for machines (_and humans somewhat_) so it would be better if we also agreed upon a standard `config.yml` or `config.yaml` (_whichever ext you prefer_) similar to `avatar.png` that other Twtxt clients like twtxt.net _can find_ and do interesting things with like "Oh you like to be called so and so, great!".
2020-08-25T22:16:01Z	@<oky https://twtxt.net/user/oky/twtxt.txt> Hey! 👋 What's up? 😀
2020-08-26T02:44:38Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [Twtxt.net](https://twtxt.ner) 😎 I’m so glad the password reset feature works 🤣 Welcome!

2020-08-26T03:26:34Z	For some _reason_ or another I can't quite work out why the default avatars (_we use identicons if you don't upload a custom avatar for your account__ aren't displaying correctly on my iPhone on Mobile Safari Hmmm 🤔
2020-08-26T03:51:46Z	🎉 And this is why I love being an SRE 😎 I _managed_ today to reduce the cost of running [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods like [Twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) by as much as 1/5th 😲 #<sre https://twtxt.net/search?tag=sre> 📷  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/UcUSQ36dfMT5dotqH5LJkE)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/FLmH2TfSuMqCUG5jN76fec)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/g9vTb932KiNrNWHfHk6thk)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/oHdnVNwkSwpjYqVJf38y48)

We can add it to our default list too 😀
2020-08-26T07:02:48Z	🍺 ⏰
2020-08-26T07:05:08Z	@felixp7Please update your Avatar 😀 See my [FYI](https://twtxt.net/twt/a36a7br5mxq) 👈 @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> and @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> you too 😎

2020-08-26T07:32:43Z	😲 We're really getting a lot of [interested in twtxt (the software that runs twtxt.net)](https://twitter.com/search?q=twtxt&src=typed_query&f=live) from ourJapanesee friends 😍 I look forward to there being more pods just like this one! 🤗
2020-08-26T08:35:38Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> glad your enjoying what we've built here! 😎
2020-08-26T08:38:52Z	@<razetime https://twtxt.net/user/razetime/twtxt.txt> Hi! 👋 Welcome to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 🤗 To answer your question re "captchas"; since you have to have a very minimal identity and account I'm not sure having a captcha makes a lot of sense. Yes a pod could be abused I suppose; but that's a problem for another day... This is designed to be distributed aferall and we also offer a hosted fully-managed 1-click pod service over at https://twt.social/
2020-08-26T08:39:54Z	@<razetime https://twtxt.net/user/razetime/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (re slickness) Thanks! 😎 We've had some pretty [awesome contributors](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/graphs/contributors) 🙇‍♂️

2020-08-26T10:33:11Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> I know! I'm going to have to unfollow the @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> bot! WOW! 😲 Its filled my timeline up!
2020-08-26T10:52:08Z	@<recipes https://twtxt.net/user/recipes/twtxt.txt> (re Date Slice) Hahaha 🤣 Also eww 🤮 I can't stand Dates! 😂
2020-08-26T11:24:29Z	@<ataco https://twtxt.net/user/ataco/twtxt.txt> (re clicking on someone's profile) Hmm if that's true, that's a bug! LMK if it happens frequently for you! 🤔

2020-08-26T11:52:30Z	@<petstorm https://twtxt.net/user/petstorm/twtxt.txt> I _have_ to ask... You've posted nothing but a flood of "followings". It's also possible you might be inadvertently increased the memory footprint of this pod! 🤣  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tRjc6B9NnnQU9JkZt9qLL7) Looks like thanks to you 😉 we might have to implement some kind of [Cache TTL](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/137) after-all and _think_ more about ways a pod can be [abused](https://dev.twt.social/twt/adv4k26brja) 😀 Still welcome! 🤗
2020-08-26T11:53:35Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> Brisbane 😀 East enough for you? 🤣
2020-08-26T11:56:39Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> Very nice! Its lovely there, my grandparents used to live there! Lovely place! (_except for all the coal dust! 🤣_)
2020-08-26T11:59:05Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> @<petstorm https://twtxt.net/user/petstorm/twtxt.txt> Nope! Its not a problem, just unexpected! As long as it wasn't "malicious"; We just have to _think_ about how to handle this, for starters rate limiting _may_ help a bit, but also the @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> bot spits out `FOLLOW`, `FEED`, `MENTION` and `WEBMENTION` events, it _could_ learn how to "bundle" them, some kind of queue and debouncing. cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt>
2020-08-26T12:00:03Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (re coal dust) Yeah that's true, they mined it all! 🤣 There _used_ to be I guess a long while back?

This is designed to be decentralised... And [it is](https://twt.social/join) So no worries 😀 We just have to _think_ carefully about edge cases like this and we're all hard at work on this! 😍
2020-08-26T12:27:55Z	Just noticed a bug 🐛 on the /followers and /following views. Just fixed it ! Should be rolled out in a few mins (_automated CD pipeline_). 🙇‍♂️

2020-08-27T00:20:33Z	📣 **FYI:** I'm going to be merging [Cache TTL](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/pull/138) soon which will get rolled out to all [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods... If you're not a technical person, don't worry! 🤗 This just means things will be faster and better for you! cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> if you guys don't mind reviewing this I'd appreciate it! I'll probably merge it after I get back from coffee at my local village. 🙇‍♂️
2020-08-27T01:58:33Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (cache ttl) no worries !
2020-08-27T05:41:32Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> I hope you’ll stick around here though! I’m not really entirely sure that I could build a social network on the Gemini protocol 😂
2020-08-27T06:41:33Z	📣 **FYI:** No, your twts are not gone! Please bare with me as I nuke the feed cache and rebuild it after merging the "Cache TTL" feature which limits the amount of data we cache in memory. This makes things go _much_ faster 🎉 The feed cache gets updated very ~5m. Patience! ⏰
2020-08-27T06:50:28Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> Good call! 🤗
2020-08-27T07:02:25Z	Oh no I can't see my own twts; What have I done?! 😱
2020-08-27T08:27:13Z	Hmmm I broke the order 😢
2020-08-27T10:55:42Z	📣 **SEV1:** Well I _feel_ really stupid tonight. When I merged the "Cache TTL' feature this afternoon, some of the logic for `max-cache-items` **was just plain wrong**. It took me a while to fix it, really sorry about that! And I was out playing table-tennis too. I can't promise this won't happen again, but this has reminded me that we need to start _slowing_ down a bit now and writing unit tests and integration tests. So sorry y'all! No twts were lost in the process, ist just a cache! 😎
2020-08-27T10:57:13Z	For those of you who may not be familiar with [Incident Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management) -- A **SEV1** is basically "everything is down" kind of incident. In this case since the global feed cache was busted and badly broken, I consider this bad enough to recognise it as such. Again my sincerest apologies! Again no twts were lost! 🤗
2020-08-27T11:29:58Z	@<razetime https://twtxt.net/user/razetime/twtxt.txt> Yes, this particular pod and the software _can_ be pronounced "Twi" "Text". Yes 😎 Or alternatively you can place the **emphasis** on the "t" in "Twit" and then "ext".

2020-08-27T11:34:29Z	Is it quiet in here because I _broke_ basically everything for a few hours tonight?! 🤣 I hope not! 😢
2020-08-27T12:16:30Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> Yeah I was, I _think_ I'm down with a cold, its really unlike me to break something so badly as I did today. I'm a bit embarrassed 😳
2020-08-27T12:16:55Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (re quietness) Tell me about it! I _think_ I need to take tomorrow off work. 😢
2020-08-27T12:34:31Z	On this plus side the (_at first disastrous_) work I did today on this platform and its software has actually improved performance considerably. The p95 latency as high as 5s seems to have just magically™ gone 🤣  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/3gNvhXMdi6BXXLwybKPzkT) 📷

2020-08-27T22:59:00Z	@<iolfree https://tilde.club/~iolfree/twtxt.txt> I love it! Keep posting quotes like this ! 😍
2020-08-27T22:59:19Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (re Mentions bug) Yes squished that too! 🎉
2020-08-27T23:01:21Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Yeah the _only_ reason  we've not focused on testing at this point is because of the "need to deliver fast". That's why I was so adamant with @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> and @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> that we get the iOS/Android Apps on some kind of automated CD pipeline just like the (_current_) Web App. Its important to deliver **fixed** bugs just as quickly as _new_ features 😀
2020-08-27T23:13:15Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (double mentions) Fixed! 😀
2020-08-27T23:13:37Z	Although give it ~5mins or so for the CD pipeline to kick in!
2020-08-27T23:15:35Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> Yup I 100% agree! Issues _should never_ be ignored, not even if its an IE11 usability one! 😉 @ @<rob https://twtxt.net/user/rob/twtxt.txt> / @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> 🤣
2020-08-27T23:20:03Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (double mentions) The nice thing about the recent changes over the last day or two is the backend restarts/updates _much_ quicker now and so there's less change of `502 Bad Gateway` errors between "old pod" and "new pod".
2020-08-27T23:20:33Z	So if we continue to do things right and don't horribly break things like I did last night (_again sorry!_), no-one should notice a damn thing, except for "new and shiny" 🤣
2020-08-28T00:27:00Z	@<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> looks like since we introduced the coach TTL an archival process the stats for the number of total parts on a local pod is now a bit wrong and off, it should probably be counting all of the ones in the case and the archive together hmmmm 🤔
2020-08-28T03:29:57Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (re Replies) I will answer you properly later this afternoon when I finish my workday (_day job_). Meanwhile do you mine [Filing an Issue](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/new)? (cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Looks like we'll fast-track the ideas we've had for how to design/implement better UX around replies sooner than later!)
2020-08-28T03:59:17Z	@<hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt> yes I really do they’re actually my favorite food! My wife makes this awesome roast potatoes which I just the most delicious thing really they are 👌
2020-08-28T06:11:10Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (re Replies) So... Let me answer properly now. We _think_ we can do this in a way that doesn't break the `twtxt.txt` spec that we use. The basic idea would be to reference the `In-Reply-To` Twt by its Hash. The UI (_the web app in this case_) can then group twts by that hash and _slightly_ indent them or show them in a single group/thread. This is the basic idea anyway. To other non-Twtxt.net/Twt.social users it would just appear as `<timestamp>\t(re #<xxxxxxx https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xxxxxxx>) ...\n` where `#<xxxxxxx https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xxxxxxx>` is a 7-character hash of the original Twt being replied to.

2020-08-28T20:21:56Z	@<eveningwear https://eveningwear.twt.social/user/eveningwear/twtxt.txt> (re cross-pod mentions) Yes I'm not really sure why your [mention](https://eveningwear.twt.social/twt/3isovjsdbka) didn't quite work, you probably discovered a bug 🐛 I'll look into it today.
2020-08-28T22:44:16Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (Rick Astley) Ahh sorry I didn't get it 🤷‍♂️ I guess I'm not up to speed with "Rick Roll'n" 🤣
2020-08-29T00:00:25Z	@<eveningwear https://eveningwear.twt.social/user/eveningwear/twtxt.txt> (re cross-pod mentions) Yes! 🎉 It turns out you had uncovered a bug which I've now fixed since [v0.1.0@ 9fc57b3](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/commit/9fc57b3dcdfe415d28b70a62caddf0d126f91b89) and this has now rolled out (_automatically_) to all hosted pods! So you should get this mention itself in your local pod's timeline on [/discover](https://eveningwear.twt.social/discover) or in your own if you follow the [twtxt](https://eveningwear.twt.social/user/twtxt) bot 😀
2020-08-29T00:01:55Z	@<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> (re [Twt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twt.js) Yes I can appreciate that it will! Please help us improve the API! The easier we make this on other devs the better the eco system :)
2020-08-29T00:30:14Z	@<eveningwear https://eveningwear.twt.social/user/eveningwear/twtxt.txt> Test cross-pod mention 😀
2020-08-29T03:15:14Z	@<eveningwear https://eveningwear.twt.social/user/eveningwear/twtxt.txt> You _may_ have now noticed (_I'm going to go to the park now, I'm done coding for now!_) that the `twtxt` feed correctly shows up on your local pod's discover timeline now. You had uncovered a fault in the feed cache by following buckket's original twtxt feed (_which is super old, stale and I don' think is active anymore!_) Thanks for finding this bug!
2020-08-29T03:18:35Z	I guess cross-pod mentions works nicely now! Cyas 👋
2020-08-29T08:11:14Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> can you share some of the e-books that you’ve written? I might be interested in getting into this kind of skill! 😁 i’m curious to know how the software works and what the end result looks like...
2020-08-29T08:26:21Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) I read your blog post in full and find your point of view rather interesting. I _never_ considered [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) to be a "walled garden", but now that you mention it I can see why you say that, _and_ I agree. After a few weeks of my joining I also noticed that the so-called "Timeline" just became full of "curated" posts that are "managed" / "controlled" by a few small no. of "community managers". This in and of itself can lead to bias and all the pitfalls that comes with.
2020-08-29T08:28:32Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) I _will_ likely continue to use Micro.blog for the foreseeable future mostly just as a way to write "blog posts" as I find it rather nice for _that specific purpose_; However my old man and I were chatting today about what I've built here on [Twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) and _we_ think we can extend the platform (_it would go outside the `twtxt.txt` format/spec slightly_) and also support long-form / blog posts as well. In fact it _might_ even be a nice "marriage" of the two forms if we do it right!
2020-08-29T08:29:28Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> And I _can_ read/download these fore FREE? (_free as in beer? 🍻_)
2020-08-29T08:48:00Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) Yes! I _hope_ we can continue this and keep it all open, honest and unencumbered.
2020-08-29T08:49:23Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (re your e-Books) Ahh no worries!

2020-08-29T12:16:17Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) I was having a chat with some folks over at [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) this evening and they _assure_ me that the only things that are curated are the "Discover" timeline and "Photography". The "Tag Emojis" are auto-generated AFAIK and your "Timeline" is completely just populated with the people you follow. So hmmm 🤔 Maybe I missed something in your blog post, I'll have to have another read...?
2020-08-29T12:50:50Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) Wait, no I'm on your side 😀I'm not convinced any kind of "curating" is actually productive to be honest. It leads to unwanted bias and social silos. I was just "questioned" about it because (_I guess?_) my Twtxt feed here is syndicated to my Micro.blog account 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-29T12:54:30Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> FWIW I asked @<manton https://twtxt.net/user/manton/twtxt.txt> some time ago if there was any possibility of self-hosting a Micro.blog instance, but the answer then was "no" and I guess its not going to happen any time soon? 🤷‍♂️
2020-08-29T13:00:47Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Sigil and eBooks) Inspired by you, I installed Sigil tonight on my Macbook and "I didn't like it" 🤣 However I started poking around and came across this nifty little tool [md2epub](https://github.com/mdigger/md2epub) which I toyed around with and some of the [examples](https://github.com/mdigger/md2epub-samples). I got it to compile and built some of the sample books. Looks like the kind of thing I'd use! 👍
2020-08-29T13:15:16Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Sigil and eBooks) Yeah can't say I've ever written a book before though so we'll see! 🤣 Going to purchase your [Vryheid](https://gumroad.com/felixp7#<kOsua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kOsua>) novel though, I've never really gotten into reading novels myself, so first time for everything I suppose 😀
2020-08-29T13:18:01Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Walled gardens in disguise) Removed? Oh that's a shame. I wonder if its in the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)? I don't even like that we _built_ a `[Delete]` feature here to be honest, but there are _very good_ reasons to be able to go back and edit your last twt or even delete it (_e.g: you said something silly, polarising, or something warranted!_); it kind of saddens me the world has gotten to a point where everything has to be "PC" and god forbid we should step on anyone's toes for fear we'll upset the poor little darlings! 🤣
2020-08-29T13:18:33Z	Put another way... "Life is too short to worry!" 🤗
2020-08-29T13:31:19Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (re Sigil and eBooks) Ahh that's kind of neat turning a series of posts into a book. _Could_ even do that with a series of Twt posts (_though you'd be doing that for a full year before you had enough content for a book!_); And no I'm sure I don't want a coupon, very generous of you! But I'll throw a few $ your way 😀
2020-08-29T13:37:39Z	I just added [Remote Mention Syntax](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/pull/151) which is basically _syntactic sugar_ that turns `@user@domain` into the twtxt URI form of `@ < nick url >`

In a way we _could_ just simply export your blog from any Twt.social pod like this one. You _can_ even export and take with you all the media you uploaded and possibly linked to as well. These capabilities are planned. Right now we _don't_ statically generate the marked up content of the Twt Blog Post itself, because its tightly integrated into Twt itself in a way that allows other Twt users to "join-in" so to speak and contribute to the discussion. In any case, hope to see more from you! 🤗
2020-08-30T23:21:26Z	It's [issues like this](https://github.com/chai2010/webp/issues/33) that remind me why I don't enjoy writing C _really_ (_and never really did_), the ecosystem is just _frankly_ terrible. Yes everything we see, hear and touch in our lives is built on it (_for examples the hundreds of millions of lines of C code that powers all of the Internet, Wen and your Mobile devices!_) but still, I really can't stand running into such silly things like linkage problems or having to fight with systems. #<sre https://twtxt.net/search?tag=sre> #<rant https://twtxt.net/search?tag=rant>

What's even more amazing is how this new Twt Blog Feature is _actually_ rather "engaging" (_or is it maybe just the #<honeymoon https://twtxt.net/search?tag=honeymoon> period?! 🤣 I guess time will tell!_) I _wonder_ if anyone else can contribute to this little collection of interesting #<Gnome https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Gnome> (s) and #<Bluey https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Bluey> (s) along random walking trails 🤔

Also you just made me think that a very useful feature for the blog posts is to be able to save a draft in your local storage so that you can come back and continue editing later. I might see if I can work on that later this week!
2020-08-31T02:51:28Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> (re injured foot) So... More #<Goryon https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Goryon> #<App https://twtxt.net/search?tag=App> development then? 🤣 (_PS: sorry to hear about your injury! 😢_)
2020-08-31T06:12:39Z	Right. ~4hrs of solid ~70% productive work (_funny how Slack is considered "distracting" even though one is required to keep-up-to-date with what your colleagues are up to!_) Must be 🍺 o' ⏰
2020-08-31T08:03:14Z	@<rell https://twtxt.net/user/rell/twtxt.txt> (re Alex Echo) Normally I would love to be the recipient of _freebies_, however over the years I have grown rather tired of all this "big brother" from Tech Giants like #<Amazon https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Amazon> #<Google https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Google> #<Facebook https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Facebook> and #<Microsoft https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Microsoft> (_Note that #<Apple https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Apple> is excluded from this list because their business model __does not__  include selling your data for advertising_) that ultimately profit off of the "Digital Footprint" you leave _happily_ just hand over to them (_well I guess it's in their T&C when you signed up!_). So thank you but no thank you 🙇‍♂️ Not fo me! But _maybe_ others _might_!

One doesn't exist currently. I can add one today? How should it work? Accept an `image/*` content-type as a `PUT`?

Conversations are only single-threaded, and they do not break the original design or spec, so it works for [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) users in the wider Twt community too! 🤗 Happy Twt'ing! 😎 📷  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gcU5bejT7c6i2GAjHaMvz3)

App developers to lose up to 50% of their revenue sounds like a case of mass exodus from the Russian market! So let me get this straight… Not only do you have to pay corporate income tax in the country that you reside in where you develop your app, but you have to lose 20% to Apple and another 30% to the Russian government.

The backing `twtxt.txt` file (_it has a name that matches the username on the pod, e.g: `felixp.txt`_) is completely unaffected. At _some_ point the backend will have to be _taught_ how to rotate your primary feed and any other feeds you manage, but that's a problem for months down the track (_again for performance reasons_). But as I said above they are no longer in the cache, but the full feed is still downloadable/consumable.

Bitcask however is a __serious__ key/value store that scale! It of course powers all Twt.social pods like this one! Its very highly efficient at what it does and incredibly low latency for read/write workloads. 😎

I was a _bit_ worried that the startup would take a while and effectively cause a downtime while it was running the cleanup job on startup to nuke all the "leaked" sessions. Nope! To my surprise it nuked all the ~450k sessions in a matter of seconds! 🎉 (_of course I'm not really sure why I was surprised! 🤣_)

I find there’s a fine line between privacy, data sovereignty and tea and data ownership. I’m not really entirely sure that there’s a lot of point to a social media network that’s basically closed and completely private; I mean at that point you may as well just have a group conversation with e2e encrypted channels right?

2020-09-05T12:13:59Z	(#<bvykn5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bvykn5a>) In fact now that I look at it, it looks like a bug in our code with some very eager regex matching on something that isn't a tag 😢
2020-09-05T12:22:14Z	(#<bvykn5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bvykn5a>) Only way I can think of to solve this (_because Go's regexp library doesn't have negative look behinds_) is to do something like this:  ```  func ExpandTag(conf *Config, db Store, user *User, text string) string { -       re := regexp.MustCompile(`#([-\w]+)`) +       re := regexp.MustCompile(`[( ,;]#([-\w]+)`) ```

Some you _might_ like to follow yourself: @<astrophotography https://twtxt.net/user/astrophotography/twtxt.txt> @<recipes https://twtxt.net/user/recipes/twtxt.txt> @<local_wonders https://twtxt.net/user/local_wonders/twtxt.txt> @<home_datacenter https://twtxt.net/user/home_datacenter/twtxt.txt> (_to name a few_)

This is what I got "alerted" to today whilst working via the beloved (_or loated?_) [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/JEQQZc6o5aVSpy6XC7QUp4) What is interested to note here (_I cut out the author and who reacted_), is that the author gave himself a "♥️" reaction, many engineers gave it a "👍" (_but never replied_) and other executives, recruiters and management folks gave it a "♥️".
2020-09-09T16:56:33Z	📣 **SEV3:** I'm very sorry about this, but I made a boo boo! 😢 I accidentally committed to master (_which rolled within ~5mins to every hosted Twt.social post we manage_) a change that caused the @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> bot to get a bit more noisy that it usually is (_once per day_).

It was more of an example of this so-called "Dopamine" effect we were talking about that is problematic with these so-called social media "Likes" / "Reactions". As much as we'd like to _believe_ they provide feedback/affirmation about one's own writing, they have the unfortunate __real__ side effect of causing human psychological problems and are _actually_ bad for some people's health (_mental health_)!

With the introduction of Operators
2020-09-14T16:27:13Z	(#<il3jmaa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=il3jmaa>) @<cncf https://feeds.twtxt.net/cncf/twtxt.txt> Its a shame to that we (_and by we I mean the Docker Swarm community, or whatever is left of it_) never really figured out how to do stateful services properly. The most frustrating aspect of Docker Swarm I've found is managing stateful workloads and having good storage volume drivers. There are many that were implemented but either a) simply don't work or b) are incomplete, buggy or broken.  Nice write up! cheers 🤗 (_btw I still run several production Swarm clusters even today!_)

Twt.social is based around a very simple concept called [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) -- Ever Twt is actually just written to a plain text file and appended.

This is a **really** good article on why I also _think_ 5G is a complete and utter joke. The whole thing is just complete nonsense to be used as a cellular transmission medium in the first place. As I've stated numerous times to various folks in my circles the mm (_millimetre_) wave lengths used as high enough and the frequencies used to have such a stupidly high attenuation rate air and water that you may as well not bother! 🤣
2020-09-20T00:02:25Z	(#<2tjspma https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2tjspma>) What these (_ignorant_) fools in the Mobile Industry (_the ones at the top_) never seemed to understand is that this technology has been around for decades and it was **specifically** designed for a _very specific_ purpose, to replace Copper/Fibre cables between short distances, say between two buildings. This is known as [802.11ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ad) and is otherwise known as "wireless wire".
2020-09-20T00:07:27Z	(#<2tjspma https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2tjspma>) For example MikroTik sell one of these (_one of my favourite wireless and wired hardware supplier_) [here](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_60g)

We actually have an [issue](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/23) to create a Desktop App, but we haven't stated this work yet... You would typically run a Pod however in some kind of "hosting" environment. We offer a fully-managed, 1-click hosted service for Twt.social pods over at [Twt.social](https://twt.social) if you're interested? However given that the community as a whole is still on the small side (_but growing every day_) you might want to hang around [this pod](https://twtxt.net) too! Make sense?

2020-09-24T06:23:15Z	I recently interviewed at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) (_first round_) a few days ago, and its a nice big! Interview went well with the new hiring manager here in Oz trying to set up a new team to build out their service offerings to the "regulated markets" (_think government agencies, etc_).  However, here's what I found in on the "right panel" in on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) today:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/NEvKoVAcrduyKzU5umbXDo) -- Boi do ads suck! 😳

Using the same underlying encryption protocols gives me even more confidence in the Signal protocol and ratcheting. It's nice. I'm split minded though about Tor and anonymous traffic (_even here in Oz our silly Govt think its useful to them to track what websites we visit via DNS_), I _think_ it comes to down a reasonable level of convenience without sacrificing too much privacy. Signal does that for me and my family/friends today. But session does look nice!

I _think_ secretly I just wanted you to write a piece like this because the issues raised above and by Richard Stallman are very so important! When you originally posted about the RMS Agenda, I was (_to be honest_) a little worried it was something else, something more sinister (_I guess I've become mistrusting of others as I get older..._). But no, this was very well written and received, the RMS Agenda that Richard Stallman started all those years ago (_I guess the year I was born?!_) is as strong and alive!

So what really is this so-called freedom of speech?! 🤷‍♂️ Near as I can tell it’s just a potentially questionable corporation imposing their own made up rules... which really they’re entitled to do as they are a private company!

2020-10-05T21:40:09Z	Speaking of guidelines, @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> just raised a good point on our Team Signal Group about [User Generated Content Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/62186) where a question was raised in the Apple Developer forums. You can read the full App Store submission/review guidelines [here](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#<user-generated-content https://twtxt.net/search?tag=user-generated-content>) -- This is a bit worrying and I'm concerned Goryon _might_ not get in in its current form and that of the Twtxt backend. What y'all think?
2020-10-05T21:42:29Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) The problem I have is that adding features to flag/moderate/delete Twts is 100% against our originally set out goals. The way I see things is quite simple, if **you** as an individual don't like some content that someone posted that **you** decided to follow, well then a) You followed them! b) You are free to Unfollow them c) You are free to go run your own Pod or join another Pod. Being completely decentralised we avoid some aspects of tpo-heavy content both good and bad. But I'm not sure if this is enough?
2020-10-05T21:43:32Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) I _should_ also point out that the micro.Blog iOS App **does not** appear to have any content flagging/reporting/moderation tools in the App. I'm asking @<manton https://twtxt.net/user/manton/twtxt.txt> about this on micro.Blog to see how they got around this. Perhaps its enough to set an age restriction of 17+ on Goryon?

2020-10-05T23:14:48Z	On the topic of [Incident Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management) in the IT Industry, I came across this (_what looks to be_) nice SaaS offering from some ex-Facebook Engineers based on the (_I must say_) very nice internal "SEV Manager". [Kintaba](https://kintaba.com/) I haven't tried it yet, but if it's anything like FB's "SEV Manager" it'll make things like OpsGenie™, PagerDuty™ and other such tools look like child's play (_many of the competitors just have no clue when it comes to SEV tooling_)...

2020-10-06T04:39:34Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) so if you feel rather strongly about having the need to have moderation tools, how do you think these should work? Are you happy if the pod owner is allowed to delete user accounts and feeds, delete individual posts? Or should the tools be more community based where one or more users can flag individual posts? The problem I have with all of this is how far do you take it and where do you draw the lines…
2020-10-06T05:02:27Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) Yeah so that was going to be my next point. We have to be very careful about what we as individuals consider harmful vs. questionable (_as some would like to put it_) content. I _think_ letting users flag posts is "okay", and allowing users to "mute"/"block" users is "okay" on the same Pod. micro.Blog for example (_only on the Web App_) has two functions a) Mute User and b) Report User...
2020-10-06T05:04:02Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) Part of me tends to believe (_having done all this years ago back in the good 'ol days of IRC where I've been a Network Admin many times_) that abusive individuals that spout violence, hatred, racisms, bullying, etc tend to only ever behave this way period and so it becomes less important to moderate/flag individual content per se but rather a user/account. What do you think? This is the route micro.Blog took I _believe_...
2020-10-06T05:05:05Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) I also worry that if we allow users to "flag" Twts, who gets to ultimately make the decision to either a) Nuke the Twt and/or b) Block/Delete the offending/abusive user/account ? The Pod Owner? A collective of persons on a Pod?
2020-10-06T05:09:46Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> Also you raise a really good point about abusers following their victims. I'm not sure we can even really block them in the first place since we don't require any type of standardised "identity" as such that _might_ be tired with things like an Email Address, Google or some other social media-type identity. Sure we can enforce things at a Pod level and maybe that's enough? You're right that we limit quite a lot of potentially "bad" things already by being decentralised, not having so-called "re-tweets" and by being non-realtime.
2020-10-06T05:52:25Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> I want to be really clear on something. WHen you say things like  > That we even need to have this conversation worries me.  For example, I'm actually offended myself  😀 So let's be clear here, I'm not arguing about whether we should or should not have tools for Pod Owners to help combat abusers or spam. What I'm trying to convey in this conversation is how we go about it without crossing lines which are typically considered "grey areas". Its more of the design choices that I want to discuss here and the implications of those...
2020-10-06T05:55:27Z	(#<i4gl4vq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=i4gl4vq>) But @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> you didn't answer my questions earlier though...  > how do you think these should work? Are you happy if the pod owner is allowed to delete user accounts and feeds, delete individual posts? Or should the tools be more community based where one or more users can flag individual posts?  In fairness  you partially answered to some of these questions ai I _think_ you'd rather see it more community based with "flagging" that brings abusive users to a Pod Owner's attention right? As a user of [this pod](https://twtxt.net) are you happy with me making decisions?

2020-10-07T06:36:54Z	In order to comply with Apple™ App Store submission/review guidelines, I've put up a PR that adds simple tools to allow users to "Mute" a user or feed removing all posts from your timeline and the local pod's discover timeline as well as the user's profile page itself. This is effectively the same as "Unfollow" + "Filter". We also added a "Report Abuse" tool that you can find on offending user's profile pages where you can report abuse. The _default_ community guidelines and abuse policy can be found at [/abuse](https://twtxt.net/abuse) Thank you. 🤗

You are right, and _frankly_ I blame the "Agile" methodology for this! The other blame I place on "users" /  "customers" not really truly knowing what they want!

2020-10-07T12:22:23Z	(#<bqoulea https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bqoulea>)   > Banning one brand and a few accounts will achieve nothing as the same crazy ideas will continue to spread under other innocently looking tags (such as Savethechildren). The real issue with FB and other social networks is that they create echo chambers where extreme views get amplified by algorithms, which are looking for messages that invoke more emotional response from users. So outrages claims and enunciation tend to spread very well, while impartial analysis of arguments tend to be ignored by algorithms.

This is proving to be harder than it should so I'll just do it where it should have been donee in the first place, some call it the Controller level :D

2020-10-09T21:01:12Z	(#<4zjlnoq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=4zjlnoq>) Okay okay, find on a more serious note its nothing to do with signal strength and _actually_ communication with the Google/Apple contract tracing API(s); rather its more to do with the flawed assumptions of "contract tracing" via Bluetooth LE in the first place, Wow so glad we wasted a few Billion dollars on all this! 😳

2020-10-11T11:18:11Z	Hey @<self_nick https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> ! 👋 Welcome to the very growing Twtxt community! 🤗 Can't say I've herad of the `twtrd/next` client before, but glad to see another fellow Twtxt user 😎
2020-10-11T11:25:43Z	Sorry @<vain https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I guess you want to be called `vain` after trying out Twtxt a few times, nuking your feed and starting over a few times? 🤣 First `self_nick`, then `httptest`? 😂 Anyway welcome again!
2020-10-11T11:39:26Z	@httptest (#<hzmixka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hzmixka>) Oh that's okay! The more clients the better I say! 😎 As for some of your other Twts, yeah look you really should support Unicode, I _understand_ (having written a Gopher library and server or two, client, desktop app and web proxy) that it strictly only understands ASCII, but yeah well that doesn't leave a lot of room for things like 😀
2020-10-11T11:42:38Z	@<vain https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Also if you want an Avatar to show up for you, you need to drop ain `/avatar.png` ath the root of where you're serving your `twtxt.txt` file from. e.g:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/2TFMb9z6hdtmBRrL7BvvAS) And an another external feed (_external to [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)_) called [beyond](https://enotty.dk/beyond.txt)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/ZocGDSYANnpAMisTy4C2Ke)
2020-10-11T12:32:27Z	Hey @<vain https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I just saw your [comment](https://nixers.net/Thread-twtxt?pid=21681#<pid21681 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pid21681>) on [nixers.net](https://nixers.net), I _tried_ to reply there but something went wrong and I can't repost my reply 😢 So I'll say it here. Just wanted to let you know that yes our primary goal is to remain compatible with the original [twtxt.txt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec. We have however extended it a bit though (_we will document this!_). We also offer a hosting service (_for convenience_) at [twt.social](https://twt.social).

I _think_ I missed this in my timeline 😢 I was just re-pursuingg my mentions and noticed this. So since you're an external user, I need to ask what client you're using? The original spec [twtxt.txt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) was a bit sparse on details, but we at [Twt.social](https://twt.social) the [software](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt) that powers [this pod](https://twtxt.net) (_and others_) extended a few things. We created this convention around a Twt's Subject and Replies. Want to know more? 😎
2020-10-11T20:21:06Z	@httptest (#<ynywg2a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ynywg2a>) Feesa IMHO should not exceed limited size! twtxt.net’s backend for example by default limits feed fetches to 2MB after which it refuses to fetch that feed anymore

2020-10-11T21:57:00Z	(#<jujnigq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jujnigq>) @<arnauld https://twtxt.net/user/arnauld/twtxt.txt> Cool... 😀 (_I hope you are using the [conversation view](https://twtxt.net/conv/jujnigq)... 🤔_); So [Twt.social](https://twt.social) is the hosting platform we also built where we offer (_currently free, invite-only_) hosted pods just like this one (twtxt.net), eventually we would charge a small fee for Pod Owners to cover costs, pay for developers and maintenance. Our business model would eventually be a small hosted offering (_**NOT** advertising, etc_).
2020-10-11T21:58:42Z	(#<jujnigq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jujnigq>) [JoinTwt.org](https://jointwt.org) is our landing page where we are _trying_ to (cc @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt>) bring everything together for both techies/nerds/geeks/hackers (_whatever you want to call it_) and everyday folk that aren't tech savvy but still want to enjoy participating and getting involved in a social media that doesn't sell them out! Here we have links to easy to read/digest documentation, our Mobile Apps (e.g: Goryon, cc @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt>) and more.
2020-10-11T22:03:04Z	(#<jujnigq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jujnigq>) Also for a taste in "video form" of what we're doing here and why check [this video](https://twtxt.net/twt/qzp2lda) out posted right here on twtxt.net 🎉
2020-10-11T22:10:58Z	(#<jujnigq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jujnigq>) To be clear... Twt.social (_what we're calling this so far, maybe we'll rebrand one day? Who knows? 🤷‍♂️_) will **always** be free to join and use! To sustain the project of course our business model is centred around providing hosting services and white-label branding. Only a single Pod Owner would pay for a pod, if they choose to, want/need the convenience or don't have the technical capabilities. Otherwise anyone is also free to run their own Pod by running the same software like @<etux https://twt.u53.us/user/etux/twtxt.txt> does over at [twt.u53.net](https://twt.u53.net) 🤗

That's about it really, the beauty about the simplicity is that it just works. A conversation that started on one pod that then has a follower on another pod gets mirrors with identical hashes on both pods.

My _thinking_ is each Pod should have a weekly cron job that cleans up stale accounts that have never posted in 3 months (_perhaps making the parameters configurable_). I figure if someone signed up to check things out, but never posted in >~3months then they don't really use this? OTOH they _could_ be idle readers so perhaps it should also check for `if created > 3 months && (sum(posts) + sum(following) == 0) ...`?

Hope you enjoy using this platform like we all do 😀 We're actually trying to get Goryon into the App Store, its already in the Google Play Store (_if you're on an Android device_).
2020-10-15T22:47:37Z	@<ammaratef45 https://twtxt.net/user/ammaratef45/twtxt.txt> Interesting... We don't render anything in the User's Profile `TagLine` 😀 We _had_ contemplated adding additional fields to the `User` model like `URL` or "other links", but we felt it wasn't really necessary or provided much value 🤔 📷  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/rwq9WqL8pjvfmvJ2aZZaaf) -- Also nice Avatar 😎
2020-10-15T22:50:32Z	So... it turns out that trying to improve [rss2twtxt](https://github.com/jointwt/rss2twtxt) to add an image and article "excerpt" to our RSS/Atom Feed aggregation service at [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) is _quite hard_ to get right. There's jst no consistency in what folks put into the `Content` or `Description` of their RSS/Atom feeds in the first place 😢 Worse yet, some folks (e.g: [ListVerse](https://listverse.com/)) put basically what I consider "garbage" at the bottom like "This post was first seen blah blah blah" which provides no value.

2020-10-18T11:49:04Z	@<maurice_renck https://maurice-renck.de/twtxt.txt> (#<firvxra https://twtxt.net/search?tag=firvxra>) You _could_ even run an instance of [jointwt/twtxt](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt) like the one [here](https://twtxt.net), Also we support both short (_twts_) and long-form (_blogs_) 😀
2020-10-18T12:01:02Z	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> (#<psrfc6q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=psrfc6q>) Oh hey there! 👋 What client do you use btw? Yes it is fun! 😎
2020-10-18T13:00:17Z	(#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Re "140 chars", pods are configurable. I configure this pod (twtxt.net) to be `288`. It also supports both short and long forms (Twts and Blogs). It does both. You can read some of my blog posts at https://twtxt.net/blogs/prologic for example.

2020-10-18T13:02:24Z	(#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Re "External September", if this _were_ to happen (_hopefully not too soon!_) this would be awesome, I would celebrate some level of success 😀 That being said, I get the overwhelming problems that can incur. Fortunately as you know Twtxt is designed to be decentralised, so are Twt.social pods like this one (twtxt.net), it is just one of quite a few now (_10 to that we know of so far, 1 of which has nothing to do with us_).
2020-10-18T13:04:49Z	(#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Re "Conversations". Please read my blog post [Making Twtxt Better](https://twtxt.net/blog/prologic/2020/10/18/making-twtxt-better) for an explanation of this. Basically we hash each Twt with a Blake2B hash and use that as the "Subject". The Twt must exist to be replied to form a conversation, you can't just make up a hash. The nice thing however is that this works across pods too. A conversation that starts on one pod and has participants in another pod, the twts get mirrorred there with the same hashes .
2020-10-18T13:23:57Z	@<gmj http://www.port111.com/george/twtxt.txt> (#<jvclmpq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jvclmpq>) Hmm good question. I guess you didn't create that account? 📷  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/6pDTx2kStDtSiKi9ygRpPG) (_or did you by accident?_) I'd have to go dump the database to see when it was created and make a decision based on that. Since no PII (_PersonalIdentifiablee Information_) is required on signup, there is no way to tell who created this or what 😀
2020-10-18T13:24:54Z	@<gmj http://www.port111.com/george/twtxt.txt> (#<jvclmpq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jvclmpq>) But to be clear... Whilst I'm the pod owner of this particular pod, I would not condone "poking at the database" and "figuring out if an account/feed can be deleted just because someone asked" 🤣
2020-10-18T13:27:44Z	@<gmj http://www.port111.com/george/twtxt.txt> (#<jvclmpq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jvclmpq>) Can you hit me up on the [/support](https://twtxt.net/support) form with your email address/name/etc so I can work this out with you? Thanks! 😀
2020-10-18T13:51:07Z	(#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) I use Go for the backend so it's a very basic Regex engine. If you want to play with the regex online you can use [this tool](https://regoio.herokuapp.com/) You can find the [documented syntax that Go uses here](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax)

I used to (_before I started twtxt.net_) use a nice command-line client written in Go by @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt> called [twet](https://github.com/quite/twet) it wasn't too bad, I quite liked it 😀 Even contributed ot it! 😎
2020-10-18T14:21:54Z	@<gmj http://www.port111.com/george/twtxt.txt> (#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Re "Your identity is your Twt URI", to be honest I'm not 100% convinced of this per se. What if you decide to change where/how you host your `twtxt.txt` feed? I did! Many others have too. See the last line of my old feed at https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt 😀 In any case it really doesn't matter tbh, since I have done so far and continue to plan to do so, keep backwards compatibility with the Twtxt spec/format and this means _any_ client _should_ work.
2020-10-18T14:24:47Z	@<gmj http://www.port111.com/george/twtxt.txt> (#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Oh _should_ have mentioned this before, but Twtxt.net (_and other Twt.social pods_) also have an API, this means we can do interesting things like for example have a mobile app. We have one for Android in the Play Store which you can find/install [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jointwtxt.goryon) if you're on an Android device.
2020-10-18T14:29:55Z	@<gmj https://www.port111.comd/user/gmj/twtxt.txt> (#<tsvhqdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tsvhqdq>) Btw... You _should_ read my [Hacktober Blog Post](https://twtxt.net/blog/prologic/2020/10/04/twt-social-hacktober-2020), if you're any good with programming and/or [Go](https://golang.org) we could use the help! That post also outlines some interesting things we want to do, for example Git integration so that one could primarily keep their `twtxt.txt` file in a Git repo somewhere, but still have say a twtxt.net account and use the Web App, API and Mobile apps as well as the command-line when they're at a terminal with access t their Git repo, etc...

Why do you think these great ideas invented and or reinvented by hackers eventually run out of steam? even this project of mine runs the risk of running out of steam too, but I damn well am sure going to try to keep the level of effort and enthusiasm behind the project!
2020-10-23T05:16:25Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (#<kbibs7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kbibs7q>) so I just finished reading the blog post you linked, and if all of those references are true that is really disgusting Mozilla! The problem I have is that the Gopher and Gemini protocols whilst are of cost simpler they have course have their own sets of problems. Pros/Cons. The real solution IMHO here is for someone to write a decent cross platform web browser that a) doesn’t suck and b) works like the original web browser should have.
2020-10-23T05:31:12Z	@<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> (#<kbibs7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kbibs7q>) well the thing is about Twtxt I think in general it ran out of steam and enthusiasm waned across-the-board years ago back in 2016 only months after it was initially launched. I am however trying to revitalize it once again and get it to a point where it can become more useful to more people not just an inner circle of hackers... whether or not we will actually succeed remains to be seen… But we have a wonderful team behind everything that we have built so far 🤗

That would cover Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and most other well-known social networks.  In my opinion profiting off user generated data and user behavior should be banned and made to be illegal.

That means _we hope_ users could actually join [other pods](https://twt.social/join) over time, even ones we don't manage like [twt.u53.us](https://twt.u53.us).

2020-10-28T02:57:05Z	@<birb https://twtxt.net/user/birb/twtxt.txt> (#<4bgr5va https://twtxt.net/search?tag=4bgr5va>)  how did you work that out? There have been more than 600 Twts on this pod 😂 if you follow the @<stats https://twtxt.net/user/stats/twtxt.txt> bot I believe we’re well over the 4000 mark since it’s launched back in August
2020-10-28T04:29:54Z	Amazing... I moved this pod to a DO VM temporarily while the storm blows over! Sorry but I wasn't able to move the fully managed Twt.social pods we also maintain on behalf of others. Just this one. Hopefully we'll get some funding soon and redo all the infra 👌
2020-10-28T04:34:00Z	(#<mlge65a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mlge65a>) Also I wasn't able to move [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) either, sorry. Ran out of time (_I was literally racing against the storm here!_).
2020-10-28T04:35:01Z	(#<mlge65a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mlge65a>) This means if you follow any of those feeds (_mostly RSS/Atom feeds as it's an RSS/Atom to Twtxt aggregator_) then you won't see any update from there until I restore that later this evening (AEST).

We haven't built this support yet, but it is something I want to do! Do you have any experience writing [Go](https://golang.org)? If so we would love the contributions! The way I was thinking of this working is to extend the command-line client we have today (`twt`) into both a traditional Twtxt client that mutates a local `twtxt.txt` file but also knows how to connect to a Twt.social pod. The expected workflow would be an (_optionaly_) occasional `twt login` and `twt sync`. What do you think?

2020-10-29T06:05:18Z	I am really quite frustrated today by [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [Open Z=Wave](http://openzwave.com/) and [Aeotec](https://aeotec.com/). Why? Today my home automation failed on me, the Z-Wave network would not start. I had to remove the virtual USB device from the VM and remove the Z-Wave Gateway USB STick from the physical Hypervisor node, add it all back for things to start working again. Once I had done that, I discovered other problems. Many nodes were "Unavailable" and "Undefined"...
2020-10-29T06:07:56Z	(#<fvafz7a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=fvafz7a>) I managed to recover a few, then discovered my custom "Display Names" for various "Entities" were all gone and had defaulted back to the factory defaults, e.g: "Hue Ambient 1".  After fiddling for a few hours I gave up. I still have at least 1 broken/missing Smart Switch 6 and one non-functioning Smart Sensor. I _really_ do not have time to be debugging complex software interactions with multiple layers, nor do I have time to be a SysAdmin. I'm finding all of this to be quite operationally frustrating at beast really.
2020-10-29T06:10:05Z	(#<fvafz7a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=fvafz7a>) I'm seriously considering whether Home Automation is mature enough or even worthwhile. Priblem is I've spent thousands of $$$ on hardware and many thousands more of my time setting it up (_if you're like me and live by "time is money"_). Right now, in my opinion, Home Automation" sucks. Home-Assistant really needs to not be written in a scripting language and OZW really needs a swift kick up their backside. /frustrated 🤬

I mean look some folks you work with get rather picky about keeping commits clean, squashing, etc. But at the end of the day ya know what matters?

We will _probably_ just called it "Messages" though. The way it'll work is you can message other users on a pod or cross-pods and your "messages" are a _special_ Twtxt feed itself only accessible to the two parties. We will also _very likely_ build out e2e public key crypto where each messages is signed and encrypted and some form of "key exchange" between users (_client side_) so the backend server **never** knows or can see the content of "private messages"
2020-11-08T00:50:39Z	Hey @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> wanna try out the improved avatar and media quality on the backend and re-upload your avatar? 🤞

Since there’s no user profiling and no way to target users or groups of users, that data isn’t as valuable to sell to advertisers, it’s only real use is in a search database like Google

2020-11-11T12:11:20Z	🎖 Wanna earn yourself a cool $350-750 USD this weekend? Go check out the [immudb's coding Challenge](https://github.com/codenotary/immuchallenge). You need to build a "Document oriented database model" atop their immudb key/value store. Seems fairly reasonable to do. Twtxt's own backend uses [Bitcask](https://github.com/prologic/bitcask) and effectively also uses a document model to store user accounts, feeds and tokens and just serializes structs as JSON into key/value pairs. Good luck! Post here if you participate and your results! 🚀

I'm just an engineering trying to make a difference 😂 And build a _better_ social platform that **actually** respect people as "users" and not a product of advertisers!

I have no idea how's Github's own "social algorithms" would have ever recommended one of my projects to you! 😳 But _somehow_ I'm glad it did ! 🤗 At the end of the day, and @<felixp7 https://twtxt.net/user/felixp7/twtxt.txt> made mention of this in [v7m47ga](https://twtxt.net/conv/v7m47ga) about Twtxt / Twt.social "losing steam", but it has not, its going along at the same pace as it ever has. We're just not going along "fast enough"™ 🤣 But OTOH I personally am __very much against__ advertising for on other platforms that sell people out!

Gogs and Gitea have it, so I personally would just ust one of those. I run Gogs myself, so I'm not that worried.

2020-11-20T15:40:28Z	(#<aepd6nq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aepd6nq>) Sorry for the ~30m delay 🤣

2020-11-21T04:29:31Z	(#<7gcpfaa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=7gcpfaa>) Sounds intriguing 😀🤔
2020-11-21T04:31:57Z	Speaking of which... I _almost_ have a full working reimplementation of [uLinux](https://github.com/prologic/ulinux)'s `box` utility that was written in pure POSIX Sh, now written in Go over at [box](https://github.com/prologic/box) -- Just working in finishing an implementation of an IPAM (_IP Address Management_) and then I _think_ I can call this done! It supports full isolation, resources (_cgroups_), pulls images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and full networking support (_very soon_). 🎉
2020-11-21T05:29:46Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<bpsds4a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bpsds4a>) And with that... [box v0.0.4](https://github.com/prologic/box/releases/tag/0.0.4) is released! 🎉 Here's proof it works: 📷   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/SJC3oMuPiP64PE6gEzeLt4)
2020-11-21T08:11:16Z	So I also just completed building [sshbox](https://github.com/prologic/sshbox) an SSH daemon/server that lets you run an arbitrary command when a user session is logged in and authorized. For example running `box run alpine /bin/sh` as the command "boxes" (_as the README states_) users into a container. There are two ways to authorized users, via an `authorized_keys` file or via Github. Just release [v0.0.1](https://github.com/prologic/sshbox/releases/tag/0.0.1) and am pretty happy with it! 🎉 Let me know if anyone would like to test it!
2020-11-21T10:48:58Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> I"m not sure what you're  observing? Can you explain in a couple of sentences like I'm five? 😀

So you'll see them more on the "Discover" (_local pod's timeone_) rather than your own "Timeline". Does that make sense? I _think_ you follow some users that I haven't seen post anything in quite some time...

We are thinking about a "Bookmarks" feature perhaps where you can bookmark Twts, but then again OTOH you can do so with a regular browser too 🤔 In any case the idea was always that "active twts" would only remain in the cache for a period of time before being archived. That is controlled by two mechanisms, a cache ttl and a max-items per feed.

2020-12-02T01:45:00Z	(#<qqgzqfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qqgzqfa>) So Git Submodules are basically references to other Git repositories that are embedded in the source repository. You manage them with `git submodule ...`. The painful thing is that you have to be careful which type of URI you add them with, `git://` or `https://` (_which can bite you in the ass depending on the rest of your pipelines_) and every time you make a change to a Git submodule's repository you have to go and update umpty nine other repositories that reference the submodule and update to point to a new Git sha. It's all quite painful and a waste of time!

Most people don't have a clue when it comes to privacy let alone encryption. One idea I had was to use NaCL crypto and store an identity key pair server-side on Twt.social pods encrypted with PBKDF2 against the user's password. That way at least we can form some kind of cryptographic "identity" without having to involve the users that much, it just works™

As it stands today you need only _really_ three things: A `twtxt.txt` file hosted somewhere, an `avatar.png` file alongside and some kind of "client" that also understand the convention around "Subject"(s) (_the thing you see in parens_). Beyond that this backend we call Twt.social pods is just a web app / client and API that allows us to also have the same on Mobile...
2020-12-02T03:21:59Z	Speaking of which... @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Did you know we have a Mobile App? It's on the App and Play store and is called "Goryon".

Speaking of which, I have to go figure out where some memory is going/leaking when upload media to a pod... The plan is to keep memory mostly stable at around ~140-150MB of RSS. This is typically what the twtxt.net pod uses.
2020-12-02T04:05:06Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> (#<jmgdkdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) I don't think we'll ever add ActivityPub -- or if we do it will only be very limited. It's quite an undertaking and doesn't really provide much value except to hook into the so-called pre-existing "Fediverse" which I'm not so convinced about anyway 😀 I'd prefer to keep the conventions, formats and protocols used (_mostly just Web based_) quite simple and adopt more of IndieWeb (_where that makes sense_). Today pods speak Twtxt via pull over HTTP. They also speak WebMentions via push to other pods (_even from other indie websites_) and they support Atom.

Anyone that wants to form a small community and get off the large-tech-gian social media platforms that collect and abuse your digital data. That's our target market, as to how small or large it is, I have no idea, but given today's climate of traditional "social media" this trend _might_ grow 😎

2020-12-02T13:25:32Z	(#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) Question: Would you pay $1.99 USD/month for a Pod? Let's assume you have a small community of friends, colleagues, family and extended family you encouraged to get off "traditional social media" on to your own pod...

In fact that’s encouraged. in an ideal world I have the next few years I would love to see 10,000 pods where Amir 10%-20% of them are hosted by us and the rest I hosted individually by following us on their own infra. Today we have 8 we host and there are 2 we don’t 👌

I don’t actually think adding activitypub and making to annexed basically yet another fediverse node would actually add any value in my opinion

The design and vision I have in mind in the long run is for there to be many pods with small communities of users friends colleagues family etc.

2020-12-06T05:24:50Z	(#<fawlu6q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=fawlu6q>) Yeah I get all that, but you can still do integer arithmetic too. Problem is despite my `ParseBoardingpass()` func being correct (_or so I think_) with correct test cases, The `higestSeatID` for my input doesn't quite come out right :/

Also solve my input puzzle. Thanks for the tips! I'm not sure what was up with my own implementation before, but I suspect an "off-by-one" which is easy to do if you're not just dealing with the straight up binary that this really is 🤣

2020-12-07T21:39:57Z	Today I’m going to play with [Storidge](https://storidge.com/) on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) cluster, and get a [RabbitMQ Stack](https://github.com/prologic/rabbitmq-swarm-cluster) working 👌

2020-12-07T21:45:48Z	(#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) correction it was an outage due to a really bad concurrency bug ![](https://twtxt.net/media/5D99aEF9rwivfjQUSjNx6b) which I wasn’t able to medicate until I got home from work that day 😳
2020-12-07T21:47:09Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) yeah we had some pretty bad storms last month however I got really good at migrating this pod to digital ocean and back with very little downtime so it actually wasn’t the storm calmer say my next twt 🤣
2020-12-07T22:08:51Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) No it’s not! Of course 🤣 But that’s because we don’t track users 😂 on purpose!

2020-12-07T22:14:40Z	(#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) what I can tell you is that there’s approximately 55 users on this pod with persistent sessions and 25 using the mobile app ![](https://twtxt.net/media/X3jrig8ESs9Gz5ZRJqR3Fa)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/QwbAPfxxLgirqooGbAQctF)

2020-12-08T13:51:06Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<tbcxz5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tbcxz5a>) Oh? Why's that? 🤔 They're just Linux Namespaces afterall...
2020-12-08T14:02:11Z	(#<w6ye24a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=w6ye24a>) Interesting 🤔
2020-12-08T14:10:03Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<tbcxz5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tbcxz5a>) That depends... If you are building static binaries, I _would_ agree with you. But deploying complex software on bare-metal or virtual-machines is actually quite error prone and not very portable at all. Docker (_if it did anything at all_) really shined in what I call a **really really good** "packaging model" and build tooling. This is now called the [OCI Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). Caching and CoW (_copy-on-write_) or OverlayFS + SHA255 of layers is a wonderful ting for portability.
2020-12-08T14:11:17Z	(#<tbcxz5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tbcxz5a>) Containers themselves OTOH have been around for the longest time, they were just made "popular" so to speak by Docker. They existed in the form of BSD Jails (_still do_), then OpenVZ for LInux, then LXC then Linux Namespaces in general (_now part of the Kernel along with CGroups_) and popularized by Docker and Kubernetes.

2020-12-08T22:59:23Z	@<jibarito123 https://twtxt.net/user/jibarito123/twtxt.txt> Did you also create an account called @<jibarito https://twtxt.net/user/jibarito/twtxt.txt> (_which looks really similar_)? Did something go wrong? 🤔 LMK if I can help in any way... Unfortunately there is no way to identify accounts at all as we collect **zero** personal information on signup, not even an email address, so if you created this account too and you'd like them both merged I can do that (_if you can prove it! 😀_)
2020-12-09T02:37:33Z	Came across [sdk.split.io](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/fh2z8x/what_does_sdksplitio_do_why_is_it_blocked/) today in my AdGuard DNS filtering. All ~4k hits are blocked but coming from my personal iMac. Kind of curious which software I'm running is using this feature flagging + analytics service `split.io` -- Anyone have any ideas on this? I typically have open at all times, Signal, Messages, Textual 7, Google Chrome, Plex Amp, Micro.Blog, ITerm 2 and Typora. I'd love to know which one of these pieces of software are using this service...
2020-12-09T04:46:07Z	I’m really disappointed with [Storidge](https://storidge.com/) It doesn’t work on a custom Linux OS or Rancher OS 😥 I doubt it’ll even run or install without problems on [CRUX](https://crux.nu) 😳 Ahy do so many software developers and companies make blatant assumptions about wheee and how you’ll run their software?! 😡

2020-12-11T03:41:44Z	(#<pdlvy3q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pdlvy3q>) it’s a really good way of pinning a Twt at the top of the timeline bar isn’t it? 🤣
2020-12-11T04:04:15Z	An editor I _sometimes_ use although sometimes that is more often than you might think... Is called [ed](https://github.com/prologic/ed) -- One day I _might_ just stop using Vim in favor of `ed` 😉
2020-12-11T04:08:37Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<pdlvy3q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pdlvy3q>) Yeah they are using their own "client" -- Or client here is a rather loose term, since Twtxt itself is just _really_ a `twtxt.txt` file hosted somewhere. What you you use here is a multi-user backend with API and a nice Mobile App (Goryon) to go along with. But under the hood it still manages a set of `twtxt.txt` files in `/data/feeds/<username>`. But no, you're right it would not be possible for any user to artificially go and post something in the future here, that would be silly, since you don't have _direct_ access to the file per se. Although...
2020-12-11T04:09:46Z	(#<pdlvy3q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pdlvy3q>) ... That _might_ change with some upcoming changes to the API and the `twt` command-line client where I will probably add things like `twt sync` that can sync between a local `twtxt.txt` file and your Twt.social account on the pod where your account lives.

2020-12-11T10:11:36Z	Hello @<hacker https://twtxt.net/user/hacker/twtxt.txt> ! 👋
2020-12-11T10:14:57Z	(#<inoxwhq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=inoxwhq>) You know `ed` right? 🤣 I _mean_ that I do quite literally use a non-visual line-based editor 😂 I _even_ used it to write a few commits for the implementation (_See [Why](https://github.com/prologic/ed#<why https://twtxt.net/search?tag=why>)..._) -- Because of my vision impairment where I only get to see a few measily lines of code anyway, it kind of makes sense that it can work for me 😌
2020-12-11T10:24:32Z	(#<inoxwhq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=inoxwhq>) Yeah :D I _might_ seriously consider using it a bit more again, I _did_ quite like it really.
2020-12-11T10:25:36Z	We _should_ probably start thinking about cleaning up old inactive accounts... 🤔
2020-12-11T10:36:05Z	(#<cn3kxka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=cn3kxka>) How so? I mean people that have swung by to "test" and "check" things out, never to be seen again. There are hundreds of accounts on this pod that have never posted a thing. If course OTOH I don't actually know if they ever login and are just idle lurkers/readers...
2020-12-11T10:36:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<cn3kxka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=cn3kxka>) It snot a problem now per se, but they do consume key space in memory as the database used for storing things like accounts and who owns what feed and sessions stores its key space in memory.
2020-12-11T10:53:45Z	(#<cn3kxka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=cn3kxka>) You _have_ to identify yourself as an owner of a feed somehow though? I mean sure I get what you're saying, each Pod _has_ accounts. The decentralised parts are the Feeds and Conversations, not so much the "Users". You have to belong to a Pod somewhere, or run your own. At _some_ point I'd like to be able to carry your "identity" around through a network of pods which I _think_ is there things like [IndieAuth](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/pulls) can help (_PR not merged yet..._).
2020-12-11T10:55:36Z	(#<cn3kxka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=cn3kxka>) Yeap all good points. LIke I said, it doesn't _really_ hurt, it just consumes key space... But that's something I _could_ solve in [Bitcask](https://github.com/prologic/bitcask) itself as a "technical" level where I evict inactive keys out of the in-memory keyspace and archive them to disk instead only keeping "active" keys in memory for fast lookups.
2020-12-11T10:56:21Z	(#<cn3kxka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=cn3kxka>) This is something I want to do anyway for Bitcask so that it can scale almost indefinitely unless your entire keyspace is hot and active all the time! 🤣

2020-12-11T11:27:42Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<luunu2q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=luunu2q>) do you mean one that doesn’t refresh or one that’s a single page?

I _think_ you've seen my say this in other Twt(s), I _fully_ intend to provide more features to the API and command-line client `twt` so what you probably _thought_ was possible **will* become possible. I'd like it myself anyway (_just becuase_), on the upside, hopefully when we get around to it it'll mean you get the best of both worlds, self-hsoted `twtxt.txt` file, synced to your "Pod" account, with API and Mobile App access 👌

2020-12-11T23:30:22Z	(#<4to7qbq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=4to7qbq>) also it’s worth noting but the hush of previously created content doesn’t actually change so if you change your feed URL it only affects you post going forward
2020-12-11T23:30:42Z	(#<4to7qbq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=4to7qbq>) or in other words it’s only a content post addressing not an identity of the user
2020-12-11T23:32:22Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> if we want to focus on trying to standardize some kind of Twtxt “identity”  then that’s a different conversation, my only personal take on this is to use EDCH25519

In non-tech contributions you _could_ spawn your own Pod, help me build more cross-pod features as a "beta" tester of said features.

2020-12-13T01:14:08Z	(#<pddmcjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pddmcjq>) The interesting thing is that it's not really possible to do this as the cache limits what it fetches by `config.MaxFetchlimit` as seen [here](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/blob/2fe0d435a7ffadce412d82e23ae6e83739e9704e/internal/cache.go#<L235-L275 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=L235-L275>) -- Unless (_assuming malicious here_) someone created a feed with ~80k old entries of nothing?

2020-12-13T08:12:39Z	(#<pddmcjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pddmcjq>) There is.a _little_ overhead though as the archived twts are stored as `.json` blobs.

2020-12-13T21:56:01Z	(#<f7rdmuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> re encryption, that sounds reasonable actually. But instead of AES, let's use Salt/NaCL. I put together [this library and tool](https://github.com/prologic/cryptutils) which uses ED25519 for your "device key pair" / or "identity key pair" and uses Curve25519, Salsa20, and Poly1305 for the actual encryption (_normal `box.Seal()`_). The only downside at the moment is single recipient only (_I borrowed most of this code from someone else_). But this lets us use [TweetNaCL](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/)
2020-12-13T22:14:22Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> (#<f7rdmuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) I'm not sure this is something we can solve. The same problem exists with Signal, GPG and _ptobabpy_ any other kind of public key crypto protocol/system. If you lose your keys, you can no longer read old messages.

2020-12-13T22:54:06Z	(#<f7rdmuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) Yup pretty much. It's all supported in [cryptutils](https://github.com/prologic/cryptutils) and it _should_ be easy to port the same code _verbatim_ using TweetNaCL; which should then work nicely on the Web App (_client-side_) and Mobile App (_using Flutter_)
2020-12-13T22:56:04Z	(#<f7rdmuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) @xii Alternatively we can decide that "group messages" are out-of-scope and then we don't have to do any extra work, the `salt` CLI tool in [cryptutils](https://github.com/prologic/cryptutils) _already_ does all the work we need. We just use the same functions and target multiple device public keys. If you install the CLI we can even do this over Twtxt to see how it plays out? :)
2020-12-13T22:56:47Z	(#<f7rdmuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) I _would_ need an out-of-band way to verify your public key's fingerprint though 🤣

Basically I have been doing the releases on my mac, and cross-compilation fails for various targets now due to various CGo dependencies used in the project. I'd like to continue using goreleaser if we can, but we might have to do the actual release builds in CI instead in a Github Action runner. But you _may_ still have to use the cross-cross complie magic referenced in that issue anyway to go from Linux -> other
2020-12-16T23:35:24Z	(#<woeyf2q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=woeyf2q>) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> The issue is that goreleaser is probably no longer a viable tool here to build binaries to attach to the release. It cross-compiles and that doesn't work now that we depend on some CGo libraires. So maybe the solution is to move the release process entirely into Github Actions and use different tools to build and upload the binaries to the release? (_I've just always done releases up until now with `goreleaser`..._)

Often-times you cannot really avoid just copying a piece of code, because you _actually_ do risk over generalising or worse adding so many layers of indirection you actually make it worse to reason about and later debug if things go wrong. Finding a balance between principles like DRY and SOLID programming is **hard** (_and I really wish we didn't have to keep coming up with these silly acronyms all the time!_)  Good read 👌

2020-12-24T00:55:49Z	(#<klxiona https://twtxt.net/search?tag=klxiona>) Yeah I kind of agree with Twitter™'s stance here of wiping out followers of accounts/feeds that effectively change hands. I mean humans / people follow other humans / people.

I was up late last night hacking on a new UI for Twtxt, a Progressive Web App. Something @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> and I are working on 😀 -- Trouble is I _really_ can't write good Javascript anymore, I find the language and its ecosystem to be frankly quite terrible, most of it is all NodeJS junk and writing client-side code is _hard_, I'd rather do it in something like [go-app](https://go-app.dev/) with Web Assembly and Go, but I'm not sure about users having to download a large binary...
2020-12-29T23:06:36Z	(#<zigpmfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=zigpmfa>) Too embarrassing right now 🤣 But you can see what it's like to build a PWA with [go-app](https://go-app.dev) with Go and Wasm [here](https://github.com/prologic/go-hello-pwa) -- I'm still deciding whether I write the App in JS or Go using WASM. I'm _really_ tempted to do the later because I'm quite rubbish at JS.

2020-12-29T23:20:49Z	(#<zigpmfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=zigpmfa>) Nothing has been decided yet. I agree, the current web app is actually very nice. Well at least I like it 😀 The mobile app (Goryon, do you use it?) is also very nice. The problem? New features are hard to keep in sync on clients like Goryon and the Twtxt backend / web app.
2020-12-29T23:34:31Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) > Can’t you just pack the current web frontend in a chromium on mobile too?  No because it's actually all a server-side rendered web app. It _actually_ works mostly just fine without Javascript enabled at all 😀 (_except media uploads_).
2020-12-29T23:34:52Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) > That’s how good it is IMO.  I'm glad you like it 🤗
2020-12-29T23:42:36Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> That doesn't really work. If you go install Goryon on a mobile device now you'll see why. It prompts you for a "Pod URL" on startup to either login to or register to. -- "Decentralised". 😀
2020-12-29T23:52:25Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Packaging it all up with a Chrome instance ala Electron isn't really viable IHMO. OTOH I'm also _thinking_ that this isn't a problem to be solved per se. Or rather, I'm not best suited to creating/maintaining a PWA client in the first place. I _should_ probably just focus on what I _am_ good at and continue improving the backend, API and continue my plans for the CLi client (_which would also improve the backend API for other clients_). I'm sort of realizing that having _many_ clients each with their own feature(s) isn't such a bad thing...
2020-12-29T23:53:13Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) In order words, focus on what makes Twtxt the spec/format and Twtxt the backend great. Keep working on cross-pod functionality, discovery, etc...
2020-12-30T00:21:00Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) That's what it has been since we started this journey back in Aug. Yes.
2020-12-30T00:45:46Z	(#<yzul4yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzul4yq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> To be honest... At this point in the project it is becoming more and more important to have a single client that works across Desktop, Mobile and Web. I'm not sure what's happening with @<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> who is the author of the [Goryon](https://github.com/jointwt/goryon) mobile app for iOS/Android, but if I don't come up with something viable that is easy to maintain and develop for me (_because contributors do come and go_) the project risks running out "stream" so to speak.

2020-12-31T23:14:13Z	So... We can _technically_ use HTTP `Range` requests for fetching Twtxt feeds to mitigate large feed sizes of clients/users that don't rotate their feeds. Problem is, this **requires** every client/user to write to their feed files as an "Append Only Log" in a newest at the bottom approach. Otherwise it doesn't work.

The value is in software distribution, and there are better tools for that (even vagrant was better).  I'm not entirely sure I agree with this statement 🤔 Having been with Docker since the start and also familiar with and used Vagrant in anger, yes, I agree Docker is great for "packaging" and "distributions", but I wouldn't go so far as to say there are better tools, certainly not Vagrant (_horribly networking for one_).
2021-01-03T23:12:38Z	(#<qwpzeka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qwpzeka>) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeap sounds like a good idea to me. Why don't you also take advantage of the Twtxt `User-Agent` format too and parse that out and filter against it? That way you can cut down on the noise. In the future you _may_ also want to extend this to support the format used by Twtxt.net when you have more than one follower from a pod 😀

I'll see if I can write something up later and see if anyone is willing to participate. For my I would do it at the network level and actually drop (by DNS and Firewall) various domains and cidr(s) of large "tech giants" mentioned here, and see what the experience is like.

2021-01-05T12:02:09Z	(#<ucmg26q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ucmg26q>) This is all true. They are however "trade offs". The main point here _I think_ is "managing change". We're not done with Twtxt by a long short (_but I still need help!_), we're close but far from "done".

2021-01-07T22:38:35Z	(#<zcqwdaq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=zcqwdaq>) @<vain https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> This is true. Although since fetching a `text/plain` resource over web protocols is pretty damn "lightweight" as it gets, I don't have a problem with that per se. I'm still running all of twtxt.net twt.social jointwt.org (_amongst other proejcts_) all on my home infra. But the technical scale aspects are not the problem for me, it's the human social scale. I don't believe the later is "scalable" at all. Social Media _should_ remain small and controllable. That's not to say however that there can't be a global decentralised and distributed network of Twtxt feeds.

In our neighborhood (_which is why we have so many of them here!_) we have someone up the road that feeds them. They went on holidays, so they're angry and mad that no-one is feeding them! These birds are actually so destructive that they'll tear bark off trees, and rip apart your house, guttering, paint, etc. 😳

It would be very niche and if you want additional software on the system, it has to be capable of being built without the use of GCC/GLIBC 🤣

Besides a whole range of software I _probably_ won't really need 😀 uLinux is pretty much Linux + Busybox userland + a few things I wrote and not much else. The init system, service management and package manager are all POSIX Shell scripts. It boots in like ~3s flat on modest hardware / virtual hardware and is really simple to use 😎

The tricky part is to work out how to persist the sandbox that you effectively end up with when you SSH in. You can _try_ this right now if you like by using your Github username, for example: `ssh -p 2222 prologic@150.101.179.238`

It's basically a full root Alpine shell (_sandboxed of course_). The only catch is that it isn't persistent (_yet_), that'll be the next thing I work on, is how to persist "sessions" if you will. What `sshbox` is is basically a small SSH server written in Go that invokes `box` another tool written in Go that sandboxes the inbound session/shell session into a container.

[Twt.social](https://twt.social) is _our_ crappy attempt at "branding" and the 1-click fully managed hosted platform for those that either a) don't know how to host/run thee backend and/or b) can't be bothered. To date my pod (twtxt.net) is the largest and most active, but there are ~7 others we host on behalf of others at https://twt.social/join as well as two others which are completely independently run at twt.u53.net and txt.sour.is

2021-01-11T14:45:54Z	(#<52smrra https://twtxt.net/search?tag=52smrra>) Good question. Mostly because they form normal #<hashtag https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hashtag>(s) anyway. THe only _special_ thing about them is they  also address a specific Twt -- i.e: Content Addressing. We _could_ make them link to the "Conversation" view, but then you' dloose the ability to search by that tag, say if a client screwed up, or twts dropped of the active cache, etc. Both the web app and mobile app know how to recognise a "reply to" and show the "Conversation" button and link to the right things. 🤷‍♂️
2021-01-11T15:00:17Z	I just built a poc search engine / crawler for Twtxt. I managed to crawl this pod (twtxt.net) and a couple of others (sorry @<etux https://twt.u53.us/user/etux/twtxt.txt> and @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I used your pods in the tests too!).

They do not however utilise ActivityPub (_for good reasons_), they operate in "pull" mode and understand Twtxt. I also offer a free RSS/Atom -> Twtxt aggregation service at [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) (_which is how I read all my news, lobsters, slashdot, etc, etc_)
2021-01-11T15:12:16Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<52smrra https://twtxt.net/search?tag=52smrra>) All good 😀 The #<hashtag https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hashtag> is more generalised and I _beliee_ we wrote a spec for it over at [dev.twtxt.net](https://dev.twtxt.net) -- So yeah its fine this way, client's just have to understand "Twt Subjects" and "Twt Hashes" and then they can use this to render similar "Conversation" views. I don't recall who here, but someone built a client called `tt` that basically renders conversation in a curses display in "threads" just like the `mutt` TUI. Amazing shit really 😎

You are right about the problems of "human socialism at scale", it doesn't scale. Keeping pods small is important in my humble opinion, but a large interconnected network of pods that is diverse is okay. There are no possible ways to create "echo chambers" here, no retweets, no likes, no algorithms.  I try to keep things as simple as as "real" as possible, if that makes sense?

I do worry about how software can be used and abused both ways, but then again there's nothing stopping anyone from running a Pod or two behind an OAuth2 authentication layer/proxy or similar anyway, so ... 🤷‍♂️ I am open to ideas however...

Do bare in mind however that twtd (_for now we call them Twt.social pods_) is designed to be memory optimized and as efficient as possible. You _could_ run it off a Raspberry Pi for example. I wanted to keep per-Pod running costs as low as possible, because one day (_when I have the time_) a monetization plan was to offer fully managed and hosted pods over at [Twt.social](https://twt.social) for ~$1.99 USD/month per Pod (_only pod owner/operator pays, users join free_).
2021-01-16T22:31:58Z	(#<lttsrtq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=lttsrtq>) So a Pod is not designed to scale to 10s of thousands of 100s of thousands of users. Plus you end up with all the same "social problems" when you start to get into those sorts of numbers anyway. So Pods should remain decentralised and not become "top heavy" with large volumes of users 😀

I noticed this before too. UTF-8 characters in username/nicknames are illegal here. Although I _guess_ they could be allowed, but that's some pretty complicated regex for me to think about 🤣

2021-01-19T00:05:29Z	(#<62rwtjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=62rwtjq>) and regarding the port. I would just bind a different host port
2021-01-19T00:06:14Z	(#<62rwtjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=62rwtjq>) be sure to set a correct base I’ll for your instance with -u

2021-01-19T06:01:27Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (#<dtbqo7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=dtbqo7q>) Yeah I _believe_ I recall someone saying that it's not about having algorithms or not having algorithms. That person stated that even sorting a timeline chronologically is an algorithm. I _think_ we have to define very clearly what algorithms means for social media and how they can be used and abused. I've thought about it a lot, and I still _believe_ that even doing simple things like showing a "Trending" section of Twts where there's a lot of twts being tagged with #<foo https://twtxt.net/search?tag=foo> is a bad idea.
2021-01-19T06:03:38Z	(#<dtbqo7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=dtbqo7q>) Maybe it's just me but I _think_ we need to keep things simple, allow humans to do the "thinking" and "choosing". It's far too easy to get into situations where you have all of the problems created by the big traditional social media platforms with Likes, Retweets, Trending, Immutable content (_it never goes away_), Top Heavy (_millions of followers_), etc.

Namely preserve the subject when replying. And if you're constructing a new conversation you need to embed the Hash of the Twt you're replying to in the Twt Subject. This is all documented at https://dev.twtxt.net/
2021-01-19T23:02:44Z	@<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#<3txg3ja https://twtxt.net/search?tag=3txg3ja>) Also on this software there is a [known bug](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/327) where deleting a Twt in your feed or modifying it that started a conversation can break the conversation chain a bit. We're not really sure yet how to address this, but it's on the back of some of our minds mostly @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> and I.
2021-01-19T23:13:38Z	@<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (#<dtbqo7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=dtbqo7q>) Agreed. I mean yes on one hand he is right, sorting algorithms are well umm "algorithms", but he's completely missing the actual point. It's the controlling what users see that's the real issue here. Or at least that's a big part of the problem.
2021-01-19T23:19:49Z	I'm _really_ excited at the prospect of 3 new pods getting spun up soon (_in the works_) by @<jlj http://ctrl-c.club/~jlj/public_html/tw.txt> @<thewismit https://twtxt.net/user/thewismit/twtxt.txt> and @oval -- Will give me the _right_ excuse to build a "migrate feed" feature so users can freely move their feed/account from one Pod to another, or even import a traditional twtxt feed and merge it with a account/feed they own on a Pod somewhere. 🤗

I _think_ if we scope out some more inter-pod (_let's call it "federation"_) features we _could_ probably improve the experience a lot here. The core bits are there, we just need to extend them. The biggest thing for me right now is refactoring the internal eventing around User-Agent detection and on-Pod Follow/Unfollow. If we can refactor that we'll have a good base to work on and build more inter-pod features.

I’m going to be changing my domain soon :)  Basically its just a convention, a "letting us know" type thing. I wouldn't worry about it too much, as pods trigger an internal @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> `FOLLOW` event anyway, so the moment you change your pod's domain and base url we'll know about it as it'll come from a different URI and re-trigger the `FOLLOW` event.

Even if you fully automate as much as you can (_like I do with my home IT infrastructure and server room full of gear_), you **still** have to occasionally replace a dead server, dead disks, do daily/weekly/monthly backups, etc. A power room is no different I suppose? 🤔 I _thinik_ the trick is to get the maintenance cost and effort as low as possible, or as 'straight forward" as possible. Complexity is the killer of all invention!

2021-01-26T00:31:14Z	(#<aetxt7a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aetxt7a>) Of course I say this and nearly every f'n place you visit these days _requires_ / _expects_ you to scan a bloody QR code, fill in some stupid ass form to say you've been here. Oh and the best part? Most of these ridiculous forms are [Google Forms](https://www.google.com.au/forms/about/) 🤬 -- You know what? "Fuck privacy!". There's no such thing anymore 😢
2021-01-26T01:22:59Z	📣 **ATT:** For those of you that use the Mobile App [Goryon](https://jointwt.org/goryon/) and are active users of my pod [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net), you **will** need to Logout and log back in again. Why? Because a recent update meant that a change to the API Signing Key was required for the JWT tokens used by API clients. Thank you! 🙇‍♂️

It will tell you what you're missing of course. Pay attention to this 😀 I'm _also_ trying to make configuring `SMTP_` optional, but for the time being this needs to be valid too (_or at least filled out and different from the defaults_). This is mostly **important** for sensitive/secret material, mostly `*_SECRET`, e.g: `COOKIE_SECRET`, `API_SIGNING_KEY` and `MAGICLINK_SECRET`.

By using `ETag` and/or `If-Modified-Since` you reduce the potential for unwanted full fetches of remote feeds. (_something I've gotten in trouble with @Evil_Bob myself and promptly fixed_). The other solution to this os to use `Range` requests (_something I plan to add to `twtd` at some point_)

Very nice 👌 I haven't read [PEDRO PIÑERA](https://ppinera.es/)'s post on [GROWING TUIST'S COMMUNITY](https://ppinera.es/2020/10/31/growing-tuist-community/) but I plan to _tonight_. I _think_ your points on documentation are very valid. We can do much better here. Whether or not we go down the Twt.social or Yarn.social branding is still up for debate, I'm a bit on the fence on this one. One thing I've really loved this week is the willingness by all you guys, yourself @<thewismit https://twtxt.psynergy.io/user/thewismit/twtxt.txt> and @<jack https://baty.twt.social/user/jack/twtxt.txt> who all have brand new pods.

They were made by some friends of our and I _think_ they could be useful somewhere, but still working out where/how/etc. One is a quick 1m intro to Twt.social (_its actually on Youtube uggh_) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxk6DwIvGVw) and the other is a interview where I answer/talk about a bunch of important issues to do with social media in general and what we're building here...
2021-01-28T00:11:34Z	(#<nxntfeq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nxntfeq>)   > When I embarked on that journey, it was clear that the community would play an important role. That's one of the things that makes Rails so unique too. It's made by people that have a lasting commitment to the project. This is rarely seen in the Swift land, where it's more common to see people come and go often. Many clickbait-type projects reach a spike of hype and stars on GitHub, and then they are abandoned or barely maintained.  This is so very true, so many projects _do_ end up like this. 😢

Being a vision impaired person myself (_actually I'm legally blind_), accessibility are really important, not only that, but UI/UX that doesn't suck is equally as important (_e.g: please don't use hovers, or popups, like ever!_)

Aside from Twt.social pods like [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_and others_), clients like jenny, tt support these. We _plan_ to send PRs to txtnish and twet as soon as we can.

They also form a "Conversation" chain on `twtd` (Twt.social) pods like you see [here](https://twtxt.net/conv/nkrjalq)

We don’t even store to use this email address only a hash of it. so the utility of direct messages becomes important for cases like when the pod owner Hass to reach out to them because perhaps maybe they’re violating the abuse policy and need a gentle reminder before being booted from that pod...

I will fix it soon, the way we _handle_ the internal `.Following` and `.Followers` attributes of users on a Pod was/is "ass backwards", it needs to be a map of `url -> nick`. Time/Energy 😀
2021-01-30T22:04:31Z	(#<ckzmiua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ckzmiua>) However ti answer @<jack https://baty.twt.social/user/jack/twtxt.txt>'s question the internal @<twtxt https://twtxt.net/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> bot basically Twts `FOLLOW` and `UNFOLLOW` (_only on-pod_) events as well as `FEED` (_on-pod feed creation_). It _can_ be useful as a way to discover new users on your pod or new followers hitting your pod. It is also very useful (_although I need to fix the damn bug!_) to discover new users as new users always emit an event that basically says they're following themselves.

They are individually managed. There has to be a good balance (_like I said_), but even more importantly the work/effort required to manage individual communities (_pods_) has to be "divided up" and "decentralised" too. That's the responsibility of the Pod Owner/Operator.

But even _that_ is prone to the problem of "seizing your device", "forcing you to unlock it", etc.  I understand what you're saying, but I'm not quite sure what you're worried about? 🤔

Most have come and gone, checked it out and never returned (_for whatever reason_). So it wouldn't take much to get to the same activity levels 😉

Like it's not even open source. You can hold me to this 🤗 Twt.social will **always** be open source, self-host(able) and encouraged to run your own (_if you can't or don't want to, we got you covered!_)
2021-02-01T13:36:26Z	(#<ugbwz5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ugbwz5a>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> Yup 🤣 The _reality_ is however that most people are "okay" with "services" where they don't have to worry about the work/effort involved in maintaining it. They prefer the convenience. The _real_ problem I'm trying to solve here though is:  > Can't we have it both way? Can't it be convenient and self-hosted, with data in your control?  And then at the end of the day, even if that's "too much" for a person or community or club or whatever, fine just sign up foo.bar. But at least we've gone to every reasonable effort to provide an open platform for all.
